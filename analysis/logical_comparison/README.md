# Logical Comparison of Confidence Interval Methods

This directory contains a simplified structure for the logical comparison of different confidence interval (CI) methods for 2x2 contingency tables.

## Directory Contents

- **logical_comparison.py** - The main script for comparing different CI methods
- **logical_comparison_report.md** - Comprehensive report with findings and recommendations
- **comparison_tables.md** - Results file generated by the script (will be created when script is run)

## Usage

To run the CI comparison script:

```bash
cd /path/to/ExactCIs
uv run python analysis/logical_comparison/logical_comparison.py [options]
```

### Options

- `--methods METHOD1,METHOD2,...` - Methods to use (default: all)
- `--test-cases CASE1,CASE2,...` - Test cases to run (default: small,medium)
- `--grid-size SIZE` - Grid size for unconditional method (default: 20)
- `--timeout SECONDS` - Timeout in seconds for unconditional method (default: 10)
- `--no-haldane` - Disable Haldane correction for unconditional method
- `--output-format FORMAT` - Output format: console, json, markdown, all (default: console)

## Purpose

The scripts in this directory are designed to test the logical consistency of confidence interval methods by:

1. Creating 2x2 contingency tables with fixed odds ratios but varying precision
2. Calculating confidence intervals using different methods
3. Comparing the widths of the confidence intervals
4. Verifying that confidence intervals get narrower with increasing counts

This analysis helps identify which CI methods are most appropriate for different scenarios and provides insights into their performance characteristics.
