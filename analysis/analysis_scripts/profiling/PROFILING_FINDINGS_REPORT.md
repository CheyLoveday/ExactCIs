- **Moderate methods (Unconditional)**: Acceptable for single calculations, questionable for batch processing
- **Slow methods (Mid-P, Blaker's)**: Significant user experience issues, timeout risks

## Critical Bottleneck Analysis

### üî¥ PRIMARY BOTTLENECK: Blaker's Method

#### Overall Performance Issues
- **Average execution time**: 0.1985 seconds per calculation
- **Timeout rate**: 14.3% (indicates computational stress)
- **Scaling behavior**: Dramatically worsens with table size (0.8+ seconds for medium tables)
- **User impact**: Unacceptable delays, reliability concerns

#### Line-Level Bottleneck Analysis

**The Critical Path** (99.8% of execution time):
```
blaker_p_value() ‚Üí blaker_acceptability() ‚Üí nchg_pdf() ‚Üí pmf_weights() ‚Üí log_binom_coeff()
```

**Specific Performance Hotspots**:

1. **`blaker_acceptability()` Line 202** - **268.346 seconds total**
   ```python
   probs = nchg_pdf(support_x, n1, n2, m1, theta)  # 99.8% of function time
   ```
   - **Issue**: Called 72 times during root finding
   - **Impact**: 3.73 million nanoseconds per call
   - **Root cause**: Expensive PMF calculations repeated without caching

2. **`pmf_weights()` Lines 372-373** - **92.268 seconds total**
   ```python
   log_comb_n1_k = log_binom_coeff(n1, k)          # 20.8% of function time
   log_comb_n2_m_k = log_binom_coeff(n2, m - k)    # 21.1% of function time
   ```
   - **Issue**: Called 37,030 times with repeated arguments
   - **Impact**: 1,237-1,254 nanoseconds per call
   - **Root cause**: No caching of binomial coefficient calculations

3. **`pmf_weights()` Line 374** - **34.260 seconds total**
   ```python
   log_term = log_comb_n1_k + log_comb_n2_m_k + k * logt  # 15.6% of function time
   ```
   - **Issue**: Arithmetic operations in tight loop
   - **Impact**: 925 nanoseconds per call (37,030 calls)
   - **Root cause**: Inefficient inner loop structure

#### Computational Complexity
- **Root finding iterations**: Multiple bisection calls require dozens of PMF evaluations
- **PMF evaluation cost**: Each call requires full binomial coefficient computation
- **No memoization**: Same calculations repeated across iterations
- **Memory allocation**: Repeated array creation in loops

### üîç DEEP DIVE: `log_binom_coeff` Function Analysis

**Critical Importance**: This function is called **52,354 times** across all profiling runs and represents the fundamental bottleneck in all slow methods.

#### Function Performance Characteristics

**Per-call execution time**:
- **Small values (n<20)**: 0.3 microseconds per call (uses `math.comb` fast path)
- **Medium values (n<200)**: 0.4 microseconds per call (uses `math.lgamma`)  
- **Large values (n>500)**: 0.5 microseconds per call (uses `math.lgamma`)

#### Code Path Analysis (`/src/exactcis/core.py:99-126`)

**Line-by-line breakdown**:

1. **Lines 114-117**: Boundary condition checks
   ```python
   if k < 0 or k > n: return float('-inf')  # Fast exit
   if k == 0 or k == n: return 0.0          # Fast exit
   ```
   - **Performance**: Very fast (negligible overhead)
   - **Usage**: ~15% of calls hit these conditions

2. **Line 120**: Type checking bottleneck
   ```python
   if isinstance(n, int) and isinstance(k, int) and n < 20:
   ```
   - **Performance**: **Type checking on every call** - unnecessary overhead
   - **Impact**: 0.05-0.1 microseconds per call (20-25% overhead)
   - **Usage**: Called 52,354 times with redundant type checks

3. **Line 121**: Fast integer path
   ```python
   return math.log(math.comb(n, k))
   ```
   - **Performance**: Very fast for small integers
   - **Usage**: ~25% of calls in typical workload
   - **Optimization potential**: Caching would benefit repeated calls

4. **Line 126**: Gamma function path  
   ```python
   return math.lgamma(n + 1) - math.lgamma(k + 1) - math.lgamma(n - k + 1)
   ```
   - **Performance**: 3x `math.lgamma` calls per calculation
   - **Usage**: ~75% of calls (majority path)
   - **Bottleneck**: Most expensive computation, called repeatedly with same arguments

#### Critical Optimization Opportunities

**üî¥ HIGHEST IMPACT - Eliminate Type Checking Overhead**:
```python
# Current (slow):
if isinstance(n, int) and isinstance(k, int) and n < 20:

# Optimized (fast):
if n < 20 and n == int(n) and k == int(k):  # Faster type checking
```
**Expected improvement**: 20-25% faster per call

**üî¥ HIGH IMPACT - Aggressive Caching Strategy**:
```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=8192)  # Much larger cache
def log_binom_coeff(n: Union[int, float], k: Union[int, float]) -> float:
```
**Call pattern analysis**:
- **Repeated arguments**: Same (n,k) pairs called 10-50 times each
- **Cache hit ratio**: Estimated 70-80% with proper cache size
- **Expected improvement**: 3-4x faster effective performance

**üü° MEDIUM IMPACT - Optimize Gamma Calculations**:
```python
# Pre-compute gamma values for common arguments
# Use vectorized operations where possible
# Consider approximations for very large values
```

#### Real-World Impact Assessment

**Current cost** (52,354 calls @ 0.4 microseconds average):
- **Total time**: ~21 milliseconds per Blaker calculation
- **Percentage of total**: ~10-15% of Blaker's execution time
- **Multiplication factor**: Called in nested loops during root finding

**Optimized cost** (with caching + type check optimization):
- **Cache hits** (70%): ~0.05 microseconds per call
- **Cache misses** (30%): ~0.3 microseconds per call  
- **Total time**: ~4 milliseconds per Blaker calculation
- **Improvement**: **5x faster**, contributing to overall 50-70% speedup

#### Specific Implementation Recommendations

**Priority 1 (immediate)**:
1. Increase cache size from 128 to 8192
2. Optimize type checking logic
3. Add cache warming for common values

**Priority 2 (short-term)**:
1. Implement specialized paths for common argument patterns
2. Pre-compute lookup tables for small values
3. Optimize gamma function call patterns

This function represents the **highest-leverage optimization target** in the entire codebase due to its extreme call frequency and current lack of optimization.
