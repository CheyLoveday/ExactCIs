# Analysis Directory

This directory contains validation scripts, comparisons, and exploratory work that supports the ExactCIs library.

## Contents

- `analysis_scripts/`: Scripts for analyzing and comparing statistical methods
- `documentation/`: Additional documentation resources
- `literature/`: Research papers and references
- `plots/`: Generated plots and visualizations
- `r_comparison/`: Scripts for comparing results with R implementations

## Usage

Scripts in this directory are primarily used for development, validation, and research purposes. They are not part of the core library but support its development and verification.

## Note

Generated files like plots (*.png) and data (*.json) are not tracked in Git. Scripts should be able to regenerate these outputs as needed.
