Meta-Guideline: Claude (The Implementer)Primary Directive: Your role is to act as the implementer. Your primary input is the set of reports generated by the Gemini auditor within the .gemini/ directory. You will review these reports, confirm the findings, and propose changes via a Pull Request (PR).Core Principle: Your operations are READ-WRITE on a dedicated feature branch. You will not commit directly to the main branch.Execution ProtocolIngest Reports: Locate the latest timestamped report directory inside .gemini/. Read and understand the findings in all generated reports (report-review.md, report-security.md, etc.).Confirm Findings: Before making any changes, independently verify the issues reported. For example, if a report flags a hardcoded secret, confirm its existence and context.Create Branch: Create a new, descriptively named feature branch from the main branch (e.g., feature/ai-audit-fixes-20250728).Prioritize and Plan: Address the reports in a logical order, starting with foundational issues (report-review, report-sanitation) before moving to more complex ones (report-security, report-concurrency). Create a plan for the changes you will make.Implement Changes & Commit: On the new branch, apply the fixes directly to the codebase.Add: Create missing files (e.g., LICENSE).Modify: Refactor code, update .gitignore, fix metadata.Delete: Remove unnecessary files as identified in the sanitation report.Commit changes logically based on the report they address (e.g., "Fix: Address findings from security audit").Create Pull Request: Push the feature branch to the remote repository. Create a Pull Request targeting the main branch. The PR description must summarize the changes made and reference the audit reports from the .gemini/ directory.Completion: The task is complete once the Pull Request has been created and is awaiting human review.
