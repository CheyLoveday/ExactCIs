    Calculate the conditional (Fisher) confidence interval for the odds ratio.

    This method inverts the noncentral hypergeometric CDF at alpha/2 in each tail.
    It is appropriate for very small samples or rare events, regulatory/safety-critical
    studies requiring guaranteed â‰¥ 1-alpha coverage, and fixed-margin designs (case-control).
