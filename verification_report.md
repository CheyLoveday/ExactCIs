# Conditional Method Optimization Verification Report

## Summary

This report verifies the claims made in the conditional method optimization issue. The optimization was claimed to have achieved a 92% performance improvement, reducing execution time from 5.20ms to 0.42ms. However, my verification testing shows significant discrepancies between the claimed and actual performance.

## Verification Steps

1. **Code Changes Verification**: ✅ CONFIRMED
   - The code changes in `conditional.py` match the described optimizations:
     - Added memoization with `@cached_cdf_function` and `@cached_sf_function`
     - Added guard clauses for early returns
     - Implemented pre-bracketing for root finding
   - All tests pass, confirming functional correctness

2. **Performance Claims Verification**: ❌ NOT CONFIRMED
   - Claimed baseline: 5.20ms
   - Claimed optimized: 0.42ms (92% improvement)
   - Actual baseline from `timing_results.json` for very_large case: 19.07ms
   - Actual current performance for very_large case: 228.48ms

## Detailed Findings

### Code Implementation

The code changes implement the optimization strategies described in the issue:

1. **Memoization**: Implemented shared cached functions for CDF/SF calculations
2. **Guard Logging**: Added logging level checks
3. **Hoisted Fixed Marginals**: Moved calculations outside closures
4. **Pre-Bracketing**: Added 3-point evaluation to narrow brackets

### Performance Testing

My performance testing shows:

- The current implementation is significantly slower than both the claimed baseline and the claimed optimized performance
- For the very_large test case (100,200,150,300), the execution time is 228.48ms
- This is approximately 44x slower than the claimed optimized performance of 0.42ms

### Possible Explanations

1. **Environment Differences**: The benchmarks may have been run in a different environment with different hardware or Python versions
2. **Measurement Methodology**: Different measurement approaches could account for some variation
3. **Implementation Issues**: The optimizations may not be working as intended in the current codebase
4. **Regression**: Performance may have regressed since the optimization was implemented

## Recommendations

1. **Re-run Benchmarks**: Conduct a comprehensive benchmark using the provided benchmark tools
2. **Profile Current Implementation**: Use line profiling to identify current bottlenecks
3. **Review Cache Implementation**: Verify the shared cache is working correctly
4. **Check for Regressions**: Compare with previous versions to identify any performance regressions

## Conclusion

While the code changes match the described optimizations and all tests pass, the performance claims could not be verified. The current implementation appears to be significantly slower than claimed. Further investigation is needed to understand the discrepancy and achieve the targeted performance improvements.
