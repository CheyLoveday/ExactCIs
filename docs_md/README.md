# ExactCIs Documentation (GitBook)

Welcome to the GitBook-native documentation for ExactCIs.

This space is in the process of migrating away from Sphinx to a Markdown-first, GitBook-integrated workflow. During this transition, some pages may be summarized or linked from the legacy Sphinx-based docs.

What youâ€™ll find here now:
- A growing set of native Markdown pages
- A dedicated page for Relative Risk methods

Planned next steps:
- Replace Sphinx auto-generated API pages with Markdown generated from the codebase (e.g., via pydoc-markdown)
- Migrate user guides, quick references, and development notes
- Maintain versioned documentation via GitBook Variants

For the latest package details and usage examples, see the API section in the navigation.
