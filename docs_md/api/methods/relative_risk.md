# Relative Risk Methods

This module provides confidence interval methods for the relative risk (risk ratio) in 2Ã—2 tables. It complements the odds-ratio focused methods with options suitable for risk-based measures.

## Overview

The relative risk (RR) compares the probability of an outcome in an exposed group to that in an unexposed group:

RR = [a / (a + b)] / [c / (c + d)]

This module implements several approaches for constructing confidence intervals for RR, handling zero cells and small-sample situations.

## Key Functions

- `ci_wald_rr`
  - Standard Wald CI on the log scale with continuity correction for zero cells
- `ci_wald_katz_rr`
  - Katz-adjusted Wald CI using a variance expression suitable for independent proportions
- `ci_wald_correlated_rr`
  - Wald CI with correlation adjustment for matched or correlated designs; falls back to standard Wald for large independent samples
- `ci_score_rr`
  - Score-based CI via inversion of a corrected score test (Tang et al.)
- `ci_score_cc_rr`
  - Continuity-corrected score-based CI with adjustable correction strength `delta`
- `ci_ustat_rr`
  - U-statistic-based CI using variance estimation per Duan et al.; uses a t critical value with small-sample adjustment

## Usage Examples

### Basic Wald CI

```python
from exactcis.methods.relative_risk import ci_wald_rr

# 2x2 table: [[a, b], [c, d]] = [[10, 20], [5, 25]]
lower, upper = ci_wald_rr(10, 20, 5, 25, alpha=0.05)
print(f"95% CI (Wald RR): ({lower:.4f}, {upper:.4f})")
```

### Katz-adjusted Wald CI

```python
from exactcis.methods.relative_risk import ci_wald_katz_rr

lower, upper = ci_wald_katz_rr(10, 20, 5, 25, alpha=0.05)
print(f"95% CI (Katz RR): ({lower:.4f}, {upper:.4f})")
```

### Score-based CI (corrected score inversion)

```python
from exactcis.methods.relative_risk import ci_score_rr

lower, upper = ci_score_rr(10, 20, 5, 25, alpha=0.05)
print(f"95% CI (Score RR): ({lower:.4f}, {upper:.4f})")
```

### Continuity-corrected score CI (tunable correction)

```python
from exactcis.methods.relative_risk import ci_score_cc_rr

lower, upper = ci_score_cc_rr(10, 20, 5, 25, delta=4.0, alpha=0.05)
print(f"95% CI (Score CC RR): ({lower:.4f}, {upper:.4f})")
```

### U-statistic-based CI

```python
from exactcis.methods.relative_risk import ci_ustat_rr

lower, upper = ci_ustat_rr(10, 20, 5, 25, alpha=0.05)
print(f"95% CI (U-stat RR): ({lower:.4f}, {upper:.4f})")
```

## Limitations

- Zero cells: Functions internally apply a small continuity correction where appropriate. Intervals may be one-sided in extreme cases (e.g., a == 0 or c == 0 for some methods).
- Design considerations: `ci_wald_correlated_rr` is intended for matched/correlated designs; it reverts to a standard Wald CI for large independent samples to avoid overly wide intervals.
- Small samples: Score-based and U-statistic approaches generally offer better coverage than unadjusted Wald intervals when samples are small or risks are near 0 or 1.
