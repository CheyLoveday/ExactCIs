# Conditional Method Optimization Investigation Summary

## Investigation Overview

This investigation examined the claimed performance improvements for the conditional method optimization in the ExactCIs library. We conducted a thorough analysis of the code implementation, performance measurements, and scaling behavior to verify the claims made in the optimization summary.

## Key Findings

1. **Optimization Implementation**: ✅ VERIFIED
   - The code correctly implements all claimed optimizations:
     - Memoization via shared cache decorators
     - Logging guards for debug statements
     - Hoisted fixed calculations
     - 3-point pre-bracketing for root finding

2. **Performance Claims**: ❌ NOT VERIFIED
   - Claimed: 5.20ms → 0.42ms (92% improvement)
   - Actual: ~230ms first run, ~8-9ms subsequent runs
   - Multiple inconsistent baselines found in documentation

3. **Cache Effectiveness**: ✅ VERIFIED
   - Shared cache system works effectively
   - First run is significantly slower due to cache initialization
   - Subsequent runs show ~25x performance improvement

4. **Scaling Behavior**: ✅ VERIFIED
   - Performance scales well with table size:
     - very_small (N=14): 5.30ms
     - medium_balanced (N=55): 6.28ms
     - large_balanced (N=275): 6.80ms
     - very_large (N=750): 8.61ms

## Conclusions

1. The optimizations are correctly implemented and effective, providing significant performance improvements after cache warm-up.

2. The performance claims in the optimization summary (92% improvement, 5.20ms → 0.42ms) could not be verified with our testing methodology.

3. The shared cache system is highly effective but introduces a significant initialization cost on the first execution that was not documented.

4. The method shows excellent scaling behavior with only modest increases in execution time as table size grows.

## Recommendations

1. Update performance claims to reflect actual measurements, including both cold-cache and warm-cache performance.

2. Standardize the benchmarking methodology to include warm-up runs, multiple measurements, and consistent table sizes.

3. Document the cache behavior and initialization costs in the library documentation.

4. Consider adding a cache pre-warming option for batch processing scenarios.

5. Implement a consistent benchmarking framework across all methods in the library.
