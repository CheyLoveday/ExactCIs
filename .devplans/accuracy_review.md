# Implementation Accuracy Review

**Date:** 2023-10-27

## Executive Summary

This review assesses the current source code for the `unconditional` and `midp` methods against the goals outlined in the project's planning and analysis documents.

The implementation of the **`unconditional` method is excellent** and fully incorporates the highest-priority changes identified in the roadmap. It successfully uses a high-performance root-finding algorithm while preserving the theoretically superior profile likelihood approach.

The implementation of the **`midp` method is partially complete**. It has been refactored to use a shared search utility, but the planned adaptive grid refinement for improved precision has not yet been implemented.

Overall, the project is in a very good state, as the most critical performance and theoretical enhancements have been completed.

## Method-Specific Analysis

### 1. Unconditional Method (`src/exactcis/methods/unconditional.py`)

**Status: ✅ Excellent**

The implementation aligns perfectly with the high-priority recommendations.

*   **Root-Finding Implemented**: The `exact_ci_unconditional` function now uses `find_confidence_interval_rootfinding` by default, which leverages a root-finding algorithm (`scipy.optimize.brentq`) instead of a brute-force grid search. This directly addresses the primary performance bottleneck.
*   **Profile Likelihood Preserved**: The implementation correctly retains the profile likelihood approach for handling the nuisance parameter, ensuring the method's theoretical advantages are not compromised. The p-value is calculated via `_log_pvalue_profile`, which finds the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) for the nuisance parameter at each step.
*   **Code Abstraction**: The core interval searching logic has been successfully abstracted into the `exactcis.utils.ci_search` module, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

### 2. Mid-P Method (`src/exactcis/methods/midp.py`)

**Status: ⚠️ Partially Complete**

The implementation has incorporated some of the planned changes but is missing a key enhancement.

*   **Code Abstraction**: The method has been successfully refactored to use the generic `find_confidence_interval_grid` function from the `ci_search` utility. This is a positive step towards better code organization.
*   **Adaptive Grid Refinement Missing**: The plan called for implementing a two-stage adaptive grid to improve precision and remove heuristic adjustments. The current implementation still uses a fixed-size grid (`grid_size` parameter). While the old hardcoded adjustments (`* 0.9`, `* 1.1`) are gone, the underlying issue of dependency on a coarse grid has not been fully addressed.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

The development team has effectively prioritized and executed the most critical tasks. The `unconditional` method is now both performant and theoretically sound.

The recommended next step is to complete the work on the `midp` method by implementing the **adaptive grid refinement** as planned. This will enhance its precision and finalize the planned improvements for both core methods.
