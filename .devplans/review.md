**Gemini Review - October 26, 2023, 4:00 PM PST**

This review synthesizes the provided documents and offers a perspective on the suggested approaches for updating the `midp` and `unconditional` methods.

The `ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` provides an excellent, data-driven overview of the current implementation. The adoption of a grid search for the `midp` method and a profile likelihood approach for the `unconditional` method are clear improvements. The empirical results validate the correctness of the new methods and highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

The recommendations in `refactoring_and_performance.md` are valuable, but must be considered in the context of the latest implementations described in the analysis report.

**On the `midp` method:**
The current grid-search implementation is robust and fast. The suggestion from `refactoring_and_performance.md` to use **adaptive grid refinement** is a natural next step. This will improve precision, especially near the confidence limits, without the computational cost of a uniformly dense grid.

**On the `unconditional` method:**
The profile likelihood approach is a significant theoretical advancement. However, the performance for large sample sizes is a valid concern. The suggestion in `refactoring_and_performance.md` to use a **root-finding algorithm like `scipy.optimize.brentq`** is a powerful recommendation. This would replace the grid search for the `theta` parameter and would likely yield a substantial performance improvement by minimizing the number of calls to the expensive p-value function. This is compatible with the profile likelihood approach, which uses optimization for the nuisance parameter at each `theta` step.

**On Code Refactoring:**
The proposal to abstract shared logic into a `_search.py` module is a good software engineering practice that will improve maintainability. The core interval searching logic (i.e., finding the `theta` values where the p-value crosses `alpha/2`) is a prime candidate for abstraction.

**Conclusion:**
The overall direction is very positive. The suggested approach should be a hybrid of the ideas presented:
1.  **Refactor** the code to abstract the common interval search logic.
2.  For the `midp` method, enhance the existing grid search with **adaptive refinement**.
3.  For the `unconditional` method, replace the `theta` grid search with a **root-finding algorithm** to address performance issues, while retaining the core profile likelihood optimization.

This combined approach will result in a more robust, performant, and maintainable library.

**Junie Review - August 5, 2025, 10:22 AM PST**

After a comprehensive review of the documentation and code for the ExactCIs library, I offer the following assessment of the suggested approaches for updating the `midp` and `unconditional` methods.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Mid-P Method
The current implementation uses a grid search with confidence interval inversion, which aligns perfectly with the mathematical foundation described in `midp_interval.md`. This approach is more reliable for large sample sizes than root-finding methods and follows the methodology used in R's `Exact` package. The implementation includes:
- Vectorized PMF calculations for efficiency
- Logarithmic spacing of the theta grid
- Adaptive theta range adjustment to ensure it includes the point estimate
- Proper handling of edge cases
- Parallel processing capabilities for batch operations

The empirical results show that this implementation produces the narrowest intervals (as expected theoretically) and has fast computation times (0.14s for the test case).

### Unconditional Method
The current implementation uses a profile likelihood approach, which is theoretically superior to supremum-based approaches. For each theta value, it finds the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the nuisance parameter p1 using scipy's optimization. Key features include:
- MLE optimization for each theta value
- Special handling to ensure the sample odds ratio is in the CI
- Vectorized calculations with NumPy for better performance
- Early termination optimizations
- Comprehensive caching system
- Parallel processing capabilities

The empirical results validate that the upper bound correctly equals the sample odds ratio (5.2105), confirming the profile likelihood approach is working correctly. However, the computational complexity (O(n₁ × n₂) for each theta) makes it slow for large sample sizes.

## Evaluation of Suggested Approaches

### Code Refactoring
The suggestion to abstract common logic into a `_search.py` module is sound. Both methods perform the same fundamental task: searching for theta values where a p-value function crosses the alpha threshold. This refactoring would:
- Reduce code duplication
- Improve maintainability
- Make it easier to implement new methods
- Provide a consistent interface for all confidence interval methods

I recommend proceeding with this refactoring as a high priority.

### Mid-P Method Improvements
The suggestion to implement adaptive grid refinement is valuable. While the current implementation is already fast and reliable, adaptive refinement would:
- Improve precision near confidence limits
- Reduce the need for heuristic adjustments
- Potentially reduce computation time by using fewer grid points in regions far from the confidence limits

This improvement should be considered medium priority, as the current implementation is already performing well.

### Unconditional Method Improvements
The suggestion to replace grid search with a root-finding algorithm like `scipy.optimize.brentq` is particularly compelling. This approach would:
- Significantly reduce the number of expensive p-value calculations
- Make the method practical for larger sample sizes
- Maintain the theoretical advantages of the profile likelihood approach
- Potentially improve precision of the confidence limits

However, there are important considerations:
1. The root-finding approach requires that the p-value function be monotonic with respect to theta, which should be verified
2. Special handling would still be needed to ensure the sample odds ratio is in the CI
3. The implementation would need robust error handling for cases where root finding fails

I recommend this improvement as a high priority, given the performance issues with large sample sizes.

## Memory Optimization Considerations
For the unconditional method, memory usage is a concern with large samples due to the joint probability matrix calculation. Potential optimizations include:
- Sparse matrix operations for tables with many zeros
- Chunked processing of the probability matrix
- Early termination based on probability thresholds
- More aggressive pruning of unlikely tables

These optimizations should be considered alongside the algorithmic improvements.

## Conclusion
The suggested approaches in the documentation are well-founded and address the key issues with the current implementations. I recommend a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Refactor the code to abstract common search logic into a `_search.py` module
2. **Phase 2**: Implement root-finding for the unconditional method to address performance issues
3. **Phase 3**: Add adaptive grid refinement to the Mid-P method for improved precision
4. **Phase 4**: Implement memory optimizations for very large sample sizes

This approach balances immediate performance gains with long-term code maintainability and will result in a more robust, efficient, and theoretically sound library.

**Cascade Review - August 5, 2025, 10:28 AM BST**

After reviewing the latest versions of the four documentation files, I concur with previous analyses and propose the following actionable approach:

1. **Shared Interval Search Abstraction (High Priority)**
   - Create a dedicated module (e.g. `_search.py`) encapsulating generic interval-finding logic.
   - Provide clear hooks for method-specific p-value calculators.
   - Benefit: removes duplication across `midp` and `unconditional`, easing future maintenance.

2. **Unconditional Method Performance (High Priority)**
   - Replace the current θ-grid scan with a bracketing root-finder such as `scipy.optimize.brentq` for each bound.
   - Preconditions: ensure monotonicity of the profile-likelihood p-value in θ; add safeguards for non-monotone edge cases.
   - Retain per-θ MLE optimisation of nuisance parameter (`p1`), but cache and reuse results across neighbouring θ evaluations when possible.
   - Add optional sparse / chunked probability handling for very large `n` to reduce memory pressure.

3. **Mid-P Method Precision (Medium Priority)**
   - Implement two-stage adaptive grid refinement around the preliminary limits to remove the current 0.9 / 1.1 heuristics.
   - Provide a user-exposed `grid_size` or `tol` parameter with sensible defaults and validation.

4. **Documentation Alignment (Low Priority)**
   - Update `ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` with latest full-suite benchmarks, including Clopper-Pearson.
   - Revise `refactoring_and_performance.md` to acknowledge the profile-likelihood superiority while still recommending root-finding for θ.

5. **Phased Roll-out**
   1. Refactor shared search module.
   2. Integrate root-finding into unconditional method.
   3. Add adaptive grid in mid-p.
   4. Optimise memory / parallel strategy as dataset sizes grow.

These steps balance theoretical soundness, performance, and code maintainability. I am ready to proceed with implementation once priorities are confirmed.
