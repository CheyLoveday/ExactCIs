# Project Brief: Developing a Unified Python Library for Confidence Intervals in Biostatistical Analysis

## Executive Summary
As of August 2025, the Python scientific ecosystem lacks a comprehensive, user-friendly library for calculating confidence intervals (CIs) for odds ratios (OR) and relative risks (RR), leading to fragmentation, manual workarounds, and reliance on R packages. This project brief synthesizes research findings, social media insights from platforms like Stack Overflow, Reddit, and X (Twitter), user personas, and proposed features to guide the development of a new package. The goal is to make Python a first-class tool for biostatistics, addressing pain points such as missing methods (e.g., Newcombe score, exact unconditional), inconsistent APIs, and visualization challenges. The proposed library would prioritize an MVP for core computations, followed by advanced features in Version 2.0.

Key findings:
- **Problem Validation:** Users express frustration with Python's incomplete support compared to R (e.g., epiR, ratesci), often resorting to custom code or rpy2 bridges.
- **Target Audience:** Intermediate to advanced users in epidemiology, statistics, and public health, who value efficiency and reproducibility.
- **Solution Outline:** A scikit-learn-like API with validated methods, reducing manual effort and building trust through R benchmarks.

## Research Summary: The Gap in Python's Biostatistical Ecosystem
Statisticians, epidemiologists, and clinical researchers require robust CI methods for OR/RR, especially in small or sparse datasets. Current Python libraries are fragmented:

- **SciPy:** Basic Wald and exact conditional intervals for OR; lacks score-based methods.
- **Statsmodels:** Strong in Mantel-Haenszel pooling for stratified data; missing continuity-corrected score intervals or exact unconditional tests for single tables.
- **Specialized Libraries (e.g., zepid):** Partial coverage but not comprehensive.

This leads to inefficiencies:
- Manual implementations of formulas.
- Inconsistent APIs across libraries.
- Bridges to R (e.g., via rpy2) for packages like ratesci or epiR.

A unified package would enable pure Python workflows, enhancing reproducibility and integration with data science tools.

## Social Media Insights: Themes and Sentiments
Analysis of discussions (primarily Stack Overflow and Reddit; limited on X/Twitter and none on Mastodon) from 2016–2024 reveals consistent frustrations. Key themes:

| Theme | Description | Example Sentiments | Platforms & Frequency |
|-------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Fragmented Library Support** | Gaps in statsmodels/SciPy for methods like Newcombe score, exact unconditional, or continuity corrections; unfavorable comparisons to R. | "Python's statsmodels gives different CI results compared to R's glm... leading to confusion." "Why doesn't statsmodels have [X] method?" | Stack Overflow (high); Reddit (r/statistics, medium). |
| **Workarounds and Manual Efforts** | Writing custom functions, bootstrapping, or using rpy2; error-prone for OR/RR from tables or models. | "Hacking together solutions" or "resorting to bootstrapping when models fail." "Users must manually exponentiate coefficients." | Stack Overflow (high); Reddit (medium). |
| **Visualization Challenges** | Difficulty plotting OR/RR with CIs (e.g., forest plots); poor integration with Matplotlib/Seaborn. | "Plotting the CI is a nightmare." | Stack Overflow (medium). |
| **Interaction Terms and Complexity** | Issues interpreting OR/RR in models with interactions; requires custom adjustments. | "Intervals don't account for interactions properly." | Reddit (low-medium). |
| **Overall Sentiment** | Mild frustration and envy toward R; Python seen as "great for data science but falling short for stats." Calls for unified tools. | "This should be simpler in Python." "Make Python catch up to R." | Cross-platform (ongoing). |

These insights confirm the need, with users desiring simplicity, validation, and comprehensiveness to avoid "jumping between languages."

## Target User Personas
Based on social media profiles and discussions (e.g., X users like @kareem_carr critiquing Python stats, @ProfMattFox on relative risks), we've developed four personas representing diverse segments: academic researchers, quantitative analysts, epidemiologists, and biostatisticians. This ensures broad coverage for feature prioritization.

### Persona 1: Alex Rivera, Biostatistical Researcher
- **Demographics:** Mid-30s–early 40s; PhD Candidate in Epidemiology or Clinical Research Analyst in academia/pharma/public health.
- **Technical Level:** Intermediate-advanced Python (Pandas, statsmodels); familiar with R as fallback.
- **Goals:** Publishing research; generating stakeholder reports; integrating biostats with ML.
- **Pain Points:** Distrust in Python CIs vs. R; manual exponentiation; visualization "nightmares." (e.g., "Why doesn't statsmodels output OR directly?")
- **Behaviors:** Posts on Stack Overflow/Reddit for solutions; seeks reproducibility.

### Persona 2: Jordan Lee, Academic Statistician
- **Demographics:** Late 20s–mid-30s; Postdoc/Assistant Professor in Statistics at universities.
- **Technical Level:** Advanced in R/Python; prefers R for stats due to Python's "sloppy" implementations.
- **Goals:** Teaching demos; publishing methods papers; interdisciplinary collaborations.
- **Pain Points:** Python libraries "horrible" (e.g., statsmodels deprecated); mashing SciPy/statsmodels; R superiority for analysis. (e.g., "R is superior to Python for statistical analysis. It’s not even close.")
- **Behaviors:** Outspoken on X about tool comparisons; values accuracy for education.
