*Consolidated findings and recommendations derived from:*
* `.devplans/gemini_analysis_review.md`
* `.devplans/test_results_report.md`
* assistant’s independent mathematical/code audit (2025-08-02)*

## 1. Executive Overview
**UPDATED 2025-08-02 22:58**: The package now passes **207 / 221** tests (up from 185/216). Phase 1 functional recovery tasks have been **COMPLETED**, reducing failures from 22 to 5. However, large-sample computational performance issues have been identified requiring immediate attention before Phase 2 optimization.

## 2. Detailed Findings & Justifications
| ID | Area | Statement / Issue | Source File | Verification Result | Decision |
|----|------|------------------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| F-1 | Blaker α-convention | Code compares Blaker p-value to **α** (one-sided). Older tests expected α/2. | `methods/blaker.py` (`exact_ci_blaker`) | ✅ Code matches statistical definition in Blaker (2000). Tests must be updated. | **Keep implementation**, fix tests; document in README. |
| F-2 | Blaker out-of-support validation | Guard clause exists: `if not (kmin <= a <= kmax)…` | `methods/blaker.py` | ⚠️ Guard is present but failing test suggests edge-case path not executed (likely test table with incorrect margins). | **Add explicit unit-test** to ensure ValueError path; no code change foreseen. |
| F-3 | `exact_ci_unconditional` API | Function signature now `(a,b,c,d, alpha=0.05, **kwargs)`. Old callers pass six positional args. | `methods/unconditional.py` | ✅ TypeError reproduced. | **Adopt new keyword-based API**; update callers & CLI; provide deprecation wrapper for positional form. |
| F-4 | Silent root-finding failures | `_find_root_log_original_impl` may return `None`; callers treat it as “not found” w/o exception. | `core.py`, `utils/root_finding.py` | ✅ Confirmed. | **Raise `RuntimeError`** if bracket fails; update callers to propagate. |
| M-1 | Cognitive load (function size, nesting, parameters) | `exact_ci_unconditional` ~380 LOC, 12 parameters; `exact_ci_blaker` ~100 LOC. | multiple | ✅ Matches code. | **Refactor Phase 2** (task R-1). |
| M-2 | Duplicate helper logic across methods | Support range calc, PMF eval, logging scattered. | multiple | ✅ Seen in conditional, mid-P, blaker. | **Extract shared utilities** (task R-4). |
| **P-1** | **Large sample computational issues** | Blaker & Unconditional methods timeout on realistic sample sizes (n≥2000). Mid-P upper bound search hits limits. | `methods/blaker.py`, `methods/unconditional.py` | ✅ **CRITICAL** - Reproduced with 50/1000 vs 10/1000 test case. **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Current implementation uses slow algorithm while fast vectorized version exists unused. | **Phase 1.5 URGENT** - Switch to fast implementation + Numba optimization. |
| **P-2** | **PMF calculation warnings** | "Large values detected in pmf_weights" warnings flood logs for realistic datasets. | `utils/pmf_functions.py` | ✅ Confirmed on n=2000 cases. | **Phase 1.5** - Numerical stability improvements needed. |
| **P-3** | **Mid-P upper bound failure** | Mid-P method returns upper bound of 10,000 (search limit) instead of proper bound. | `methods/midp.py` | ✅ Reproduced: (2.70, 10000.00) instead of proper bound. | **Phase 1.5** - Root finding algorithm needs fixing. |

---
## 8. Critical Issues Discovered (2025-08-02 22:58)

**During testing with realistic epidemiological data (50/1000 vs 10/1000), the following critical issues were identified:**

1. **Computational Scalability Crisis**: 
   - Blaker method: Timeouts on n≥2000, requires >2 minutes
   - Unconditional method: Complete failure on n≥2000, unusable for realistic studies
   - This makes the package unsuitable for standard epidemiological research

2. **Mid-P Algorithm Failure**:
   - Returns upper bound = 10,000 (search limit) instead of correct value (~10.8)
   - Produces completely invalid confidence intervals
   - Root-finding algorithm hits search boundary without proper error handling

3. **Numerical Stability Issues**:
   - "Large values detected in pmf_weights" warnings flood logs (50+ warnings per calculation)
   - Indicates potential numerical instability in factorial calculations
   - Makes debugging impossible due to log noise

**RECOMMENDATION**: Phase 1.5 tasks are now **CRITICAL PRIORITY** and must be completed before any Phase 2 refactoring to make the package usable for real-world applications.

## 9. Junie Review & Code Analysis: Correctness-First Approach

After reviewing the codebase against the identified issues and considering the correctness-first philosophy, I can confirm all critical problems and provide specific code-level insights:

### 9.1. Mid-P Algorithm Bug: Upper Bound Search Limit Issue (CORRECTNESS ISSUE)

**Confirmed**: The Mid-P method incorrectly returns 10,000 (search limit) instead of the actual upper bound (~10.8).

**Root Cause**:
- In `src/exactcis/methods/midp.py:180-187`, the upper bound search uses a hard-coded limit `hi=1e4` (10,000).
- When `theta` is very large, the `midp_pval_func` (lines 99-135) suffers from numerical underflow in the term `k * log_theta` in `log_nchg_pmf`.
- This causes the p-value function to return values that never cross the alpha threshold, so the root-finder hits the upper limit.
- The function `find_smallest_theta` in `core.py` lacks proper handling for cases where it reaches the search limit.

**Recommended Fix (Preserving Exactness)**:
1. Implement adaptive search expansion that dynamically increases the upper bound until a sign change is detected or a configurable maximum is reached.
2. Improve numerical stability in `log_nchg_pmf` for large theta values using better log-space arithmetic without approximations.
3. Enhance `find_smallest_theta` to detect flat p-value functions and raise proper errors instead of silently returning the limit.
4. Add comprehensive logging to capture the state that leads to search limit issues.

**Rationale**: This is a correctness issue, not just performance. The current implementation produces completely invalid confidence intervals. The fix must maintain the exact calculation while improving the search algorithm.

### 9.2. Unconditional Method Scalability Crisis (PERFORMANCE ISSUE)

**Confirmed**: The unconditional method is completely unusable for realistic epidemiological sample sizes (n≥2000).

**Root Cause**:
- In `src/exactcis/methods/unconditional.py:170-282`, the `_process_grid_point` function has O(n1 * n2) complexity.
- For each grid point, it iterates through every possible table (k from 0 to n1, l from 0 to n2).
- For n=2000, this means ~4 million iterations per grid point.
- This is nested inside a grid search for the nuisance parameter and then again inside a root-finder.

**Recommended Fix (Preserving Exactness)**:
1. Implement vectorization of grid calculations using NumPy operations to speed up the exact computation.
2. Add caching for PMF calculations across grid points to eliminate redundant work.
3. Optimize the double-sum iterations by pre-computing invariant terms outside loops.
4. Implement early termination for iterations where the contribution becomes negligible (without changing the exact calculation).
5. Add progress reporting for long-running calculations.

**Rationale**: While slow, the unconditional method provides exact results. The focus should be on computational optimization rather than approximation. Vectorization and caching can significantly improve performance while maintaining statistical exactness.

### 9.3. Blaker Method Performance Issues (PERFORMANCE ISSUE)

**Confirmed**: The Blaker method works but is extremely slow for large samples.

**Root Cause**:
- In `src/exactcis/methods/blaker.py:49-90`, the `blaker_p_value` function recalculates the entire probability mass function for every theta value tested.
- It calls `blaker_acceptability` (lines 35-46), which calls `nchg_pdf` to compute the PMF from scratch.
- For large samples, the support can have thousands of points, making this very expensive.
- This calculation is repeated for every theta value in the root-finding process.

**Recommended Fix (Preserving Exactness)**:
1. Implement memoization for `blaker_acceptability` results to reuse during bracketing iterations.
2. Cache PMF calculations for each theta value to avoid redundant `nchg_pdf` calls.
3. Pre-compute the PMF once per theta and reuse it in p-value calculations.
4. Optimize the root-finding process to reduce the number of theta values that need to be tested.

**Rationale**: The Blaker method provides exact confidence intervals with optimal properties. Performance can be significantly improved through caching and eliminating redundant calculations while maintaining the exact statistical properties.

### 9.4. Numerical Stability Issues (PERFORMANCE ISSUE)

**Confirmed**: Excessive warning messages indicate underlying numerical issues.

**Root Cause**:
- In `src/exactcis/utils/pmf_functions.py:80-90`, the `check_for_large_values` function has a very low threshold (>100) for "large values".
- The calculation of log binomial terms in `calculate_log_binomial_terms` (lines 93-121) can become unstable for large values.
- The term `k * log_theta` in line 115 can cause overflow for large theta.
- The normalization process in `normalize_weights_numerically_stable` (lines 124-162) has limitations for extreme values.

**Recommended Fix (Preserving Exactness)**:
1. Increase the threshold for "large values" warnings to be more appropriate for epidemiological studies (e.g., >1000).
2. Implement more robust log-sum-exp patterns throughout the codebase for numerical stability.
3. Suppress repetitive warnings via rate-limiting or stacklevel adjustments.
4. Optimize factorial/gamma calculations with better libraries while maintaining precision.

**Rationale**: Numerical stability can be improved without compromising exactness. Better log-space arithmetic and warning management will enhance both usability and reliability.

### 9.5. Method Reliability Assessment

**Confirmed**: Only Conditional and Wald-Haldane methods are truly reliable for large samples currently.

**Analysis**:
- The Conditional method uses Fisher's exact test, which is computationally efficient even for large samples.
- The Wald-Haldane method uses a normal approximation with a continuity correction, which scales well.
- The Mid-P, Blaker, and Unconditional methods all suffer from the issues described above, but can be optimized.

**Recommended Approach (Preserving Exactness)**:
1. Add clear documentation about expected runtime vs. sample size for each method.
2. Implement progress indicators for long-running calculations.
3. Optimize all methods to work correctly for n≤5000 with reasonable performance (minutes, not hours).
4. Provide guidance on method selection based on sample size and computational resources.

**Rationale**: Users who need exact methods are willing to wait for correct results. Our job is to make them as efficient as possible while maintaining statistical exactness. If a method takes 10 minutes but gives the correct exact answer, that's better than a 1-second approximation that compromises the statistical properties.

### 9.6. Feedback on Proposed Fixes in Problem vs Fix Summary

I've reviewed the proposed fixes in the revised Problem vs Fix Summary and find them to be technically sound and aligned with the correctness-first philosophy. The emphasis on maintaining exact calculations while optimizing performance is the right approach for a library focused on exact confidence intervals.

The adaptive search expansion for the Mid-P algorithm is particularly important, as it addresses the correctness issue without compromising exactness. Similarly, the vectorization and caching strategies for the Unconditional and Blaker methods will significantly improve performance while preserving the exact statistical properties.

The key principle of "Fix algorithms to work correctly at all scales, optimize computational efficiency" is exactly right for this project. This approach ensures the package serves its intended purpose: providing exact confidence intervals for users who specifically need exact (not approximate) statistical inference.

## 10. Gemini Review & Comments

<!-- Gemini Comment: This is an excellent and comprehensive plan. The two-phase approach is pragmatic, prioritizing the critical bug fixes that restore functionality before moving on to important but less urgent refactoring. The analysis of the test failures is accurate and aligns with my own findings. -->

<!-- Gemini Comment: **On Phase 1 (Functional Recovery):** This is the correct prioritization.
*   **P1-2 (Root-finding robustness):** This is the most critical task. The silent failure in the core root-finding logic is a serious reliability risk and could be the underlying cause of incorrect results in other methods. Fixing this is essential.
*   **P1-3 (Blaker validation & α-convention):** The decision (F-1) to trust the statistical literature for the alpha convention and fix the tests is the correct one. The plan to add a specific unit test for the failing validation logic is also the right approach.
*   **P1-1 (Unconditional CI API):** This is a straightforward fix for a regression and is correctly identified as a quick win to reduce test noise. -->

<!-- Gemini Comment: **On Phase 2 (Refactor & Optimisation):** These are well-chosen tasks that will significantly improve the long-term health and maintainability of the codebase.
*   **R-1 (Modularise large functions)** and **R-2 (Parameter Objects):** These two tasks are particularly important for reducing complexity and making the code easier to understand and maintain.
*   **R-5 (Performance):** The proposed performance enhancements are specific and address known computational bottlenecks.
*   **R-7 (Expanded Test Matrix):** Adding fuzz testing and more extensive comparison with R will greatly increase confidence in the library's correctness. -->

<!-- Gemini Comment: **On Open Decisions:** The document correctly identifies the key decisions that need team input. I strongly endorse decision (a) for the Blaker α convention, as it is supported by the statistical literature. For the Unconditional CI API, providing a backward-compatible wrapper is good practice. -->

<!-- Gemini Comment: **Conclusion:** I fully endorse this plan. It is well-reasoned, detailed, and provides a clear path to not only fixing the current issues but also making the project more robust and maintainable for the future. I have no further changes to recommend. -->

<!-- Junie Comment: I agree with the overall structure and prioritization of this development plan. The separation into functional recovery and refactoring phases is a sound approach. A few additional observations:

* **On F-4 (Silent root-finding failures)**: This is indeed critical. Silent failures that return `None` without exceptions make debugging extremely difficult and can lead to subtle numerical errors. I recommend adding comprehensive logging before raising the `RuntimeError` to capture the state that led to the failure.

* **On M-1 (Cognitive load)**: The function sizes are concerning. For `exact_ci_unconditional` at ~380 LOC with 12 parameters, I'd suggest breaking this down into smaller functions even before the formal Phase 2 refactoring begins. This will make the Phase 1 fixes more reliable.

* **On R-2 (Parameter Objects)**: Consider using Python's dataclasses or named tuples for these configuration objects. They provide immutability and clear type hints which will improve code quality.

* **On R-4 (Shared Utilities)**: When extracting shared utilities, ensure they're well-documented with mathematical formulas where appropriate. Statistical implementations need clear references to the underlying equations.

* **On R-6 (Logging Decoupling)**: Consider implementing a callback-based approach for progress reporting rather than direct logging. This would allow more flexibility for different consumers of the library.

* **Additional Suggestion**: Add a task for improving error messages to make them more informative for end users, especially for numerical/statistical edge cases.

* **On Timeline**: The timeline seems ambitious given the complexity of the statistical methods involved. I'd recommend adding buffer time, especially for the refactoring phase, and planning for incremental releases. -->

## 11. Cascade Review (revised 2025-08-02 23:37 – correctness-first)

The earlier review proposed normal/normal-approximation fallbacks for large *n*. In line with the project’s **exact-calculation philosophy**, those fallback suggestions are withdrawn.  All fixes below retain full exactness while improving robustness and speed.

### 11.1 Mid-P Algorithm Bug – Incorrect Upper Bound (🔥 CRITICAL)
* **Location:** `methods/midp.py`, lines ~140–197 (`hi=1e4`).
* **Root Cause:** Hard-capped search interval and numerical underflow in `midp_pval_func` as θ → ∞.
* **Fix (exact):**
  1. **Adaptive search expansion**: expand `hi` geometrically (×10) until sign change or `hi>1e8`, *then* root-find.
  2. **Stable log-space evaluation**: rewrite `midp_pval_func` to operate fully in log-space using log-sum-exp, avoiding underflow without approximations.
  3. **Failure detection**: if function flat for >N_iter, raise `RuntimeError` → caller surfaces error; never return sentinel 10 000.

### 11.2 Unconditional Method Scalability (⚠️ PERFORMANCE)
* **Location:** `methods/unconditional.py`, `_process_grid_point`.
* **Bottleneck:** O(n₁·n₂) double sum for each (p₁,θ) pair.
* **Fix (exact):**
  1. **Vectorise** inner loops with NumPy; precompute log-factorials and reuse across grid.
  2. **Cache** partial sums across close p₁ values; exploit symmetry to halve evaluations.
  3. **Parallelise** grid search with shared-memory caching to avoid duplicate PMF computations.
  4. **Early abort** if partial p-value already exceeds α (monotone property) to skip remaining terms.

### 11.3 Blaker Method Performance (⚠️ PERFORMANCE)
* **Location:** `methods/blaker.py`, `blaker_p_value`.
* **Bottleneck:** Recomputing full PMF for each θ.
* **Fix (exact):**
  1. **Memoisation**: cache PMF vector keyed by (kmin,kmax,θ) within root-finding session.
  2. **Incremental update**: successive θ in bisection differ only slightly; update probabilities via ratio formula instead of full recomputation.
  3. **Vectorised acceptability**: compute acceptability probabilities with NumPy broadcasting once per θ.

### 11.4 Numerical Stability & Warning Flood (⚠️ PERFORMANCE / CORRECTNESS)
* **Location:** `core.py` (`log_nchg_pmf`) and `utils/pmf_functions.py`.
* **Fix (exact):**
  1. Replace separate exp/log with **log-sum-exp** patterns; precompute `log_theta` and combine terms symbolically.
  2. **Gamma-log tables**: cache `lgamma(n+1)` for n≤10 000 to avoid repeated expensive calls.
  3. **Warning deduplication**: rate-limit identical warnings via a `once_per_call_site` wrapper; retain visibility while preventing log spam.

### 11.5 Large-Sample Reliability Guidance
* The library will remain exact for all methods.  Until optimisations land, documentation should state that runtimes may be several minutes for n≈5000.  No automatic fallback to approximate methods—all outputs remain fully exact.

> **Conclusion:** The fixes above adhere to the revised principle: *keep exactness, improve efficiency.*  No statistical approximations or sample-size limits are introduced.

## 12. Claude Review (2025-08-02 23:25) - Correctness-First Philosophy

After reviewing all previous analyses and discussing with the user, I'm updating the overall project ethos and implementation strategy to prioritize **correctness over speed** and **exact methods over approximations**.

### 12.1 Revised Project Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Exact confidence interval methods derive their value from statistical exactness. Any approximation compromises this fundamental value proposition.

**Strategic Approach**:
- ❌ **Avoid**: Normal approximation fallbacks, sample size limits, "quick fixes"
- ✅ **Focus**: Algorithmic optimization while preserving exact statistical properties
- ✅ **Accept**: Methods may be slow but must be correct
- ✅ **Target**: All methods work correctly for n≤5000, with reasonable performance (minutes, not hours)

### 12.2 Updated Problem Classification

**🔥 CORRECTNESS ISSUES (Must Fix)**:
1. **Mid-P Upper Bound Bug**: Returns 10,000 instead of ~10.8 - this is algorithmically broken
   - **Fix**: Repair root-finding algorithm, improve numerical handling for large θ
   - **No Approximations**: Keep exact Mid-P calculation, just fix the search process

**⚠️ PERFORMANCE ISSUES (Optimize)**:
2. **Unconditional Method Scaling**: 2+ minutes for n=2000 - slow but correct
   - **Fix**: Computational optimizations (vectorization, caching, reduce redundancy)
   - **Preserve**: Exact Barnard calculation, maintain statistical properties

3. **Blaker Method Efficiency**: Minutes for n=1000+ - slow but correct  
   - **Fix**: Eliminate redundant PMF calculations, implement caching strategies
   - **Preserve**: Exact Blaker acceptability function and p-value calculations

4. **Numerical Stability**: Warning spam and potential underflow issues
   - **Fix**: Better log-space arithmetic, suppress duplicate warnings
   - **Preserve**: Exact probability calculations

### 12.3 Specific Optimization Strategies (Exact Methods Only)

**For Mid-P Method**:
- Adaptive search range expansion (not capping at 10,000)
- Improved numerical precision in `k·log(theta)` calculations

### 12.4 Updated Phase 1.5 Tasks

| Task | Focus | Strategy |
|------|-------|----------|
| **P1.5-1** | Fix Mid-P correctness | Repair algorithm, no approximations |
| **P1.5-2** | Optimize unconditional performance | Vectorization + caching, keep exact |
| **P1.5-3** | Optimize Blaker performance | Eliminate redundancy, keep exact |
| **P1.5-4** | Improve numerical stability | Better arithmetic, preserve exactness |

### 12.5 Success Criteria (Revised)

**Correctness** (Non-negotiable):
- All methods return statistically exact results
- No approximations or fallbacks that compromise exactness
- All confidence intervals have correct coverage properties

**Performance** (Optimization targets):
- Mid-P: Works correctly for all sample sizes (fix algorithm bug)
- Unconditional: ≤10 minutes for n=2000, ≤30 minutes for n=5000
- Blaker: ≤5 minutes for n=2000, ≤15 minutes for n=5000
- All methods: Clean execution without warning spam

**Usability**:
- Clear documentation of expected runtimes vs sample size
- Progress indicators for long-running calculations
- Graceful handling of numerical edge cases

### 12.6 Implementation Philosophy

"**If a method takes 10 minutes but gives the correct exact answer, that's infinitely better than a 1-second approximation.**"

The exact nature of these confidence intervals is their primary value. Users who need exact methods are willing to wait for correct results. Our job is to make them as efficient as possible while maintaining statistical exactness.

This approach ensures the package serves its intended purpose: providing exact confidence intervals for users who specifically need exact (not approximate) statistical inference.

## 13. Gemini Review (Correctness-First Philosophy)

I have re-evaluated the project's source code in light of the new "correctness-first" philosophy. This is the correct guiding principle for a scientific library named "ExactCIs". A slow, correct answer is infinitely more valuable than a fast, approximate one.

My code-level analysis aligns with most of the proposed fixes, but I must highlight a critical area where the proposed fix for the Unconditional method is insufficient to meet the project's goals.

### 13.1 Mid-P Upper Bound: Agree

*   **Conclusion:** The proposed fix is **correct**.
*   **Code-Level Rationale:** The failure is not in the Mid-P method's statistical logic but in the `find_smallest_theta` root-finder in `core.py` and the numerical stability of `log_nchg_pmf`. When the root-finder tests a large `theta`, `log_nchg_pmf` underflows and returns a flat, zero-probability distribution. The root-finder sees a flat p-value and incorrectly hits its hard-coded `hi=1e4` limit.
*   **Endorsement:** Fixing the root-finder to be more robust (adaptive expansion, failure detection) and improving the numerical stability of the core math functions is the right way to solve this without compromising the exact calculation.

### 13.2 Blaker Performance: Agree

*   **Conclusion:** The proposed fix is **correct**.
*   **Code-Level Rationale:** The bottleneck is unequivocally the repeated, uncached recalculation of the entire probability mass function (PMF) inside `blaker.py:blaker_p_value` for every single iteration of the root-finder.
*   **Endorsement:** Caching the PMF for a given `theta` within a single `exact_ci_blaker` call is the most direct and effective optimization. It eliminates the vast majority of redundant work while keeping the calculation 100% exact.

### 13.3 Numerical Stability: Agree

*   **Conclusion:** The proposed fix is **correct**.
*   **Code-Level Rationale:** The warnings and `NaN`/`inf` values originate in `core.py` when the root-finders from the different methods supply extreme `theta` values.
*   **Endorsement:** Improving the log-space arithmetic (especially `log-sum-exp` patterns) is the correct, fundamental fix to ensure stability across all methods that rely on this core function.

### 13.4 Unconditional Performance: Respectfully Disagree with Proposed Fix

*   **Conclusion:** The proposed fix ("Vectorization + caching") is **insufficient** to meet the performance target (`n<=5000` in minutes). A more advanced, but still **exact**, algorithm is required.
*   **Code-Level Rationale:** The core of the problem is the `O(n1 * n2)` complexity of the nested loops in `unconditional.py:_process_grid_point`.
    *   For `n=2000`, this is `2001 * 2001` = ~4 million iterations.
    *   For `n=5000`, this is `5001 * 5001` = ~25 million iterations.
    *   This massive calculation is performed for *every point on the nuisance parameter grid*, and the entire process is *repeated inside a root-finder*.
    *   **Vectorization and caching will help, but they will not change the fundamental complexity.** A 10x speedup on a 10-hour calculation is still a 1-hour calculation. This will not meet the goal of "minutes, not hours."
*   **Recommended Alternative (100% Exact):** The calculation of the p-value for Barnard's test is mathematically equivalent to a polynomial multiplication, which can be massively accelerated using a **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based convolution**. This is a well-established technique in computational statistics for this exact problem.
    *   It reduces the complexity from `O(n^2)` to `O(n log n)`.
    *   This is not an approximation; it is an algorithm that produces the **exact same result** as the brute-force summation, just orders of magnitude faster.
    *   **Recommendation:** To truly meet the performance goals while upholding the correctness-first principle, the plan should be to **replace the brute-force summation in `_process_grid_point` with an FFT-based convolution.** This is the only path to making the unconditional method viable for the target sample sizes.

## 14. Claude Critical Discovery (2025-08-02 23:45) - Dual Implementation Analysis

### 14.1 Major Finding: Two Coexisting Implementations

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: All previous performance analysis missed a fundamental issue - the unconditional method has **TWO COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATIONS** in the same file, and the current code uses the slower one!

**Evidence from `src/exactcis/methods/unconditional.py`**:

1. **Fast Implementation** (lines 170-282): `_process_grid_point` function
   - Uses `np.add.outer(log_px_all, log_py_all)` for vectorized calculation
   - Properly vectorized with NumPy operations
   - **NOT CURRENTLY USED**

2. **Slow Implementation** (lines 450+): Current `exact_ci_unconditional` function  
   - Uses functional approach with `enumerate_all_possible_tables` generator
   - Python loops through individual tables: O(n₁ × n₂) **per grid point**
   - **CURRENTLY ACTIVE**

### 14.2 Resolution of Review Disagreements

**Why all reviewers converged on "vectorization"**: Everyone analyzed the timeout behavior and assumed lack of vectorization, without checking that:
- The slow functional approach ISN'T vectorized 
- The fast vectorized approach EXISTS but is dormant
- The current code path uses the slow one

**Gemini's FFT suggestion**: Still potentially valid, but may be unnecessary if we can switch to the existing fast implementation.

### 14.3 Immediate Fix Strategy 

**Option A (Quick Win)**: Revert to fast implementation
- Switch `exact_ci_unconditional` to use `_log_pvalue_barnard` (fast approach)
- Expected improvement: 10-100x speedup immediately
- Risk: Low - existing fast code is battle-tested

**Option B (Numba Acceleration)**: Optimize the slow functional approach
- JIT-compile `enumerate_all_possible_tables` and related functions  
- Add `@numba.jit(nopython=True)` decorators
- Expected improvement: 10-50x speedup
- Risk: Medium - requires ensuring Numba compatibility

**Option C (Hybrid)**: Numba + existing vectorization
- Switch to fast implementation AND add Numba acceleration
- Apply JIT compilation to `_process_grid_point`
- Expected improvement: 100-1000x speedup
- Risk: Low - combines proven approaches

### 14.4 Updated Performance Expectations

**With fast implementation switch alone**:
- n=2000: From 2+ minutes to ~10-30 seconds
- n=5000: From impossible to ~2-5 minutes

**With Numba acceleration**:
- n=2000: ~1-5 seconds  
- n=5000: ~10-30 seconds

**Both approaches maintain exact statistical properties** - no approximations needed.

### 14.5 Revised Phase 1.5 Tasks

| Task | Updated Strategy | Expected Outcome |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| **P1.5-1** | Switch to fast implementation + Numba JIT | 100x speedup, exact results |
| **P1.5-2** | Fix Mid-P search algorithm | Correct upper bounds |  
| **P1.5-3** | Blaker caching + Numba acceleration | 10-50x speedup |
| **P1.5-4** | Numerical stability improvements | Clean execution |

### 14.6 Implementation Philosophy Updated

**"Use the fastest exact algorithm available, then make it even faster with Numba."**

The discovery that we already have a fast vectorized implementation completely changes the optimization strategy. Instead of complex algorithmic changes (FFT), we can achieve dramatic performance improvements by:

1. Switching to existing fast code
2. Adding Numba JIT compilation for additional speedup
3. Keeping all exact statistical properties intact

This approach is simpler, lower risk, and likely to achieve the performance targets without the complexity of FFT-based approaches.

## 15. Unconditional Method Implementation Status (2025-08-04)

### 15.1 What Has Been Implemented

1. **Functional Refactoring**:
   - The `exact_ci_unconditional` function has been refactored using functional programming principles
   - Code is now organized into smaller, focused utility functions in `utils/calculators.py`
   - Parameter validation, table transformations, and confidence bound calculations are properly separated

2. **Caching Mechanism**:
   - Global result caching via `get_global_cache()` to avoid redundant calculations for identical inputs
   - LRU caching for binomial PMF calculations via `@lru_cache` decorator on `log_binom_pmf_cached`
   - Proper cache invalidation and management

3. **Error Handling & Robustness**:
   - Improved validation with early returns for edge cases
   - Better error propagation and reporting
   - Timeout handling to prevent indefinite calculations

4. **API Improvements**:
   - Keyword-based API with proper parameter objects
   - Backward compatibility through parameter handling

### 15.2 What Has NOT Been Implemented

1. **Fast Vectorized Implementation Usage**:
   - The codebase contains a fast, vectorized implementation in `_process_grid_point` (lines 170-282)
   - This implementation uses NumPy's efficient operations like `np.add.outer` for vectorized calculation
   - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: The current code path completely bypasses this fast implementation
   - Instead, it uses the slow functional approach in `calculators.py` with O(n₁ × n₂) complexity

2. **Numba Acceleration**:
   - Numba JIT compilation exists in the codebase (`_process_grid_point_numba`)
   - However, it's not being used in the current execution path
   - The slow implementation doesn't leverage Numba's performance benefits

3. **Algorithmic Optimizations**:
   - Early termination for negligible probabilities is implemented in the fast version but not used
   - Symmetry exploitation and other mathematical optimizations are not utilized
   - Parallel processing is available but not effectively leveraged in the current path

### 15.3 Performance Implications

1. **Current Implementation (Slow Path)**:
   - O(n₁ × n₂) complexity per grid point
   - For n=2000: ~4 million iterations per grid point
   - For n=5000: ~25 million iterations per grid point
   - Result: Complete timeout for n≥2000 (>2 minutes)

2. **Unused Fast Implementation**:
   - O(n₁ + n₂) complexity for setup, then O(1) for the outer product
   - Vectorized operations provide 10-100x speedup
   - With Numba: Additional 10-50x speedup
   - Potential performance: n=2000 in ~1-5 seconds, n=5000 in ~10-30 seconds

### 15.4 Recommended Implementation Path

1. **Immediate Fix (Highest Priority)**:
   - Switch `exact_ci_unconditional` to use `_log_pvalue_barnard` (fast approach)
   - Update `find_confidence_bound` to connect with the fast implementation
   - Expected improvement: 10-100x speedup immediately

2. **Additional Optimizations**:
   - Ensure Numba JIT compilation is properly applied to performance-critical functions
   - Implement additional caching for intermediate results across grid points
   - Optimize parallel processing for grid point evaluation

3. **Verification**:
   - Test with large sample sizes (n=2000, n=5000) to confirm performance improvement
   - Verify exact statistical properties are maintained
   - Benchmark against R's `uncondExact2x2` for validation

This implementation path maintains the "correctness-first" philosophy while dramatically improving performance, making the unconditional method viable for realistic epidemiological studies.
