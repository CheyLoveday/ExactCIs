A Methodological Audit and Strategic Analysis of Confidence Interval Estimation for 2x2 Tables in the Python EcosystemPart I: A Methodological Primer on Confidence Intervals for Proportional DataThe analysis of 2x2 contingency tables is a cornerstone of biostatistics, epidemiology, and numerous other scientific fields. These tables provide a simple yet powerful framework for quantifying the association between a binary exposure (e.g., a treatment or risk factor) and a binary outcome (e.g., disease or recovery). The primary statistics derived from these tables—the relative risk (RR) and the odds ratio (OR)—are fundamental for making inferences about treatment efficacy and risk. However, a point estimate of an OR or RR is of limited value without a corresponding confidence interval (CI) to quantify its precision.1 The choice of method for calculating this confidence interval is not trivial; different methods possess distinct statistical properties, performance characteristics, and underlying assumptions. A thorough understanding of these methods is therefore a prerequisite for evaluating the capabilities of any statistical software library. This section establishes the necessary theoretical foundation by defining the key measures of association and providing a detailed taxonomy of the computational methods used to derive their confidence intervals. This framework will serve as the benchmark against which the Python and R software ecosystems are subsequently audited.Section 1.1: Measures of Association: Relative Risk vs. Odds RatioIn epidemiological and clinical research, data are often categorized into a 2x2 contingency table to examine the relationship between an exposure and an outcome. The standard notation for such a table is as follows, where individuals are classified based on their exposure status (e.g., exposed vs. unexposed) and outcome status (e.g., cases vs. non-cases).4Outcome Positive (Cases)Outcome Negative (Non-Cases)TotalExposed Groupaba+bUnexposed Groupcdc+dTotala+cb+da+b+c+dFrom this structure, two primary measures of association are calculated: the relative risk and the odds ratio.Relative Risk (RR), also known as the risk ratio, is the ratio of the probability (or risk) of an outcome in the exposed group to the probability of the outcome in the unexposed group. It directly compares the incidence of the outcome between the two groups.6 The formula for the sample RR is:RR=P(Outcome Positive∣Unexposed)P(Outcome Positive∣Exposed)​=c/(c+d)a/(a+b)​An RR of 1.0 indicates that the risk is identical in both groups. An RR greater than 1.0 suggests the exposure increases the risk of the outcome, while an RR less than 1.0 suggests the exposure is protective and reduces the risk.5 Because it is a direct ratio of incidence proportions, the RR is highly intuitive and is the preferred measure in prospective studies, such as cohort studies and randomized controlled trials, where incidence can be directly measured over time.5 For example, an RR of 2.0 means the risk of the outcome is twice as high in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group.Odds Ratio (OR) is the ratio of the odds of an outcome in the exposed group to the odds of the outcome in the unexposed group. The odds of an event are defined as the probability of the event occurring divided by the probability of it not occurring. The formula for the sample OR is 2:OR=Odds(Outcome Positive∣Unexposed)Odds(Outcome Positive∣Exposed)​=(c/d)(a/b)​=bcad​An OR of 1.0 indicates no association between the exposure and the outcome. An OR greater than 1.0 suggests the exposure is associated with higher odds of the outcome, and an OR less than 1.0 suggests lower odds.1 The OR is the primary measure of association used in case-control studies. In this study design, researchers sample individuals based on their outcome status (cases and controls) and then look backward (retrospectively) to determine their exposure status. Because the total number of exposed and unexposed individuals in the population is not known from the sample, the true risks or proportions cannot be calculated directly, making the RR inaccessible. The OR, however, can be calculated and provides a valid measure of association.1A critical point of consideration is the relationship between the OR and RR. The OR serves as a good approximation of the RR only when the outcome of interest is rare in the population (typically defined as a prevalence of less than 10%).1 For common outcomes, the OR will always be further from 1.0 than the RR, thereby exaggerating the magnitude of the association.1 For instance, if an RR is 2.0, the corresponding OR will be greater than 2.0; if an RR is 0.5, the OR will be less than 0.5. This divergence can lead to misinterpretation if the OR is uncritically presented as an estimate of the relative risk in studies of common diseases.12 This fundamental distinction underscores the necessity for statistical software to provide robust and distinct methods for both measures, as they are not interchangeable and their appropriate use depends on the study design and outcome prevalence.Section 1.2: A Taxonomy of Confidence Interval Estimation MethodsA point estimate for an RR or OR provides a single value for the strength of an association, but it carries no information about the uncertainty inherent in that estimate. A confidence interval (CI) remedies this by providing a range of plausible values for the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%).1 If a 95% CI for an RR or OR does not include the null value of 1.0, the result is considered statistically significant at the 0.05 level.1 The method used to calculate the CI is of paramount importance, as different methods offer trade-offs between computational complexity, performance with small or sparse data, and the validity of their underlying asymptotic assumptions. The major families of CI methods are detailed below.1.2.1 Asymptotic Log-Transform (Wald-type) MethodsThe most widely taught and implemented method for calculating CIs for ratios like the OR and RR is the log-transform method, often referred to as the Wald-type or Katz-log interval.5 The distribution of the OR and RR is often skewed, especially with small sample sizes, whereas the distribution of their natural logarithms, log(OR) and log(RR), is more closely approximated by a normal distribution.7 This method leverages this property by constructing a symmetric CI on the log scale and then exponentiating the endpoints to transform them back to the original ratio scale.For the odds ratio, the confidence interval is computed based on the assumption that log(OR) is normally distributed with a standard error given by 2:SE(log(OR))=a1​+b1​+c1​+d1​​The 100(1−α)% confidence interval for the log(OR) is then:log(OR)±Z1−α/2​×SE(log(OR))where Z1−α/2​ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% CI). The final CI for the OR is obtained by exponentiating the lower and upper bounds of this interval.For the relative risk, a similar procedure is followed. The standard error for log(RR) is given by 5:SE(log(RR))=a1​−a+b1​+c1​−c+d1​​=a(a+b)b​+c(c+d)d​​The CI is then constructed on the log scale and exponentiated. While computationally simple and widely available, Wald-type methods perform poorly when sample sizes are small or when any of the cell counts (a,b,c,d) are zero.14 A zero cell count makes the standard error formula undefined. A common but ad-hoc fix is to add a small constant, typically 0.5, to all cells in the table, a practice known as a continuity correction.5 However, this can introduce bias, and more sophisticated methods are generally preferred.1.2.2 Asymptotic Score MethodsScore methods, first proposed by Wilson for a single proportion, represent a significant improvement over Wald-type intervals. Instead of constructing a symmetric interval around the point estimate, score CIs are formed by inverting a score test. A score test evaluates the null hypothesis without needing to estimate the parameter under the alternative hypothesis. The resulting CIs are not necessarily symmetric around the point estimate on the log scale, which allows them to better adapt to the underlying data distribution. They generally exhibit superior coverage properties, meaning the actual probability of the interval containing the true parameter value is closer to the nominal level (e.g., 95%) than Wald intervals, especially with smaller samples.Several important variants of the score method exist for 2x2 tables:Miettinen-Nurminen (M-N) and Farrington-Manning: These are foundational score methods for comparing two proportions, applicable to risk difference, relative risk, and odds ratio.19 They are known for their good performance and are often used as benchmarks.Koopman Score: This is a well-regarded score method specifically for the relative risk.Tang Score: This is another important score method for the relative risk, proposed by Tang (2020), which is available in advanced R packages like ratesci.19Continuity Correction (CC): Just as with Wald intervals, score intervals can be modified with a continuity correction (e.g., a Yates-style correction) to make their coverage more conservative and better approximate the results of "exact" methods.19Skewness-Correction (SCAS): A further refinement of the score method is the Skewness-Corrected Asymptotic Score (SCAS) interval, developed by Gart, Nam, Laud, and others.20 These methods incorporate a correction for the skewness of the test statistic, leading to CIs with excellent coverage properties that are very close to those of computationally intensive exact methods, even with sparse data.1.2.3 "Exact" Methods for Sparse DataWhen sample sizes are very small or cell counts are zero, the asymptotic assumptions underlying both Wald and score methods may not hold. In these situations, "exact" methods, which do not rely on large-sample theory, are required.Conditional Exact (Fisher's Exact): The most common exact method is the conditional exact interval, often associated with R.A. Fisher. For the odds ratio, this method is based on conditioning on all row and column marginal totals of the 2x2 table. The probability of observing any particular table, given the fixed margins, follows Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution, with the odds ratio as the noncentrality parameter.4 The CI is found by "inverting" this distribution to find the range of OR values for which the observed table is not statistically extreme. While this method guarantees that the coverage probability will not fall below the nominal level (e.g., 95%), this guarantee often comes at the cost of the interval being overly wide and conservative.21Unconditional Exact: To overcome the conservatism of the conditional approach, unconditional exact methods were developed. These methods condition on only one set of margins (e.g., the total sample sizes of the two groups) and treat the other as random. They involve maximizing p-values over the possible values of a nuisance parameter, making them computationally much more intensive. However, they are generally more powerful and yield narrower, less conservative intervals than the conditional exact method. Notable examples include Blaker's exact CI.241.2.4 Stratified Analysis (Mantel-Haenszel)In many studies, the association between an exposure and an outcome may be confounded by a third variable (a confounder). To control for this, data are often stratified into multiple 2x2 tables, one for each level of the confounding variable. The Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method is a standard technique for analyzing such stratified data.19 It provides a pooled, or adjusted, estimate of the odds ratio or relative risk across all strata, assuming the effect is consistent (homogeneous) across them. The method calculates a weighted average of the individual stratum-specific estimates, giving more weight to larger, more precise strata. Crucially, the MH procedure includes formulas for the standard error of the pooled log(OR) and log(RR), allowing for the construction of confidence intervals for the adjusted effect measures. This is an essential tool for meta-analysis and for any observational study aiming to produce an unconfounded estimate of effect.201.2.5 Methods for Paired or Matched DataStandard methods for 2x2 tables assume that the two groups being compared (e.g., exposed and unexposed) are independent. This assumption is violated in study designs involving paired or matched data, such as a pre-test/post-test study on the same individuals or a case-control study where each case is matched with a specific control. For these designs, specialized methods are required. These methods properly account for the correlation between the paired observations. Examples include methods based on McNemar's test for homogeneity 29 and more advanced techniques like Tango's score CI for the difference of paired proportions or U-statistic-based methods for the paired RR.241.2.6 Resampling Methods (Bootstrap)The bootstrap is a powerful and flexible non-parametric method for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic and constructing confidence intervals.14 Instead of relying on distributional assumptions, it uses computational power to simulate the sampling process. The procedure involves repeatedly drawing samples with replacement from the original dataset, calculating the statistic of interest (e.g., OR or RR) for each resample, and using the resulting distribution of these statistics to form a CI.While several types of bootstrap CIs exist (e.g., percentile, basic), the Bias-Corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap is widely recommended as the gold standard.31 It adjusts the simple percentile interval to account for both bias and skewness in the bootstrap distribution, resulting in CIs with excellent coverage properties across a wide range of conditions. A key advantage of the bootstrap is its generality; it can be applied to any computable statistic, making it a versatile tool.31 However, its effective use requires careful implementation, especially for ratios like OR and RR, where issues like zero cell counts in resamples must be handled gracefully and transformations (like the log transform) can improve performance.Part II: A Feature-by-Feature Audit of the Python Statistical EcosystemHaving established a methodological framework, this section undertakes a rigorous audit of the primary Python libraries used for statistical analysis. The goal is to determine the extent to which each library provides the comprehensive suite of confidence interval methods for odds ratios and relative risk outlined in Part I. The analysis focuses on the core scientific libraries SciPy and statsmodels, the epidemiology-focused zepid, and the generic bootstrapping toolkits.Section 2.1: The Core Scientific Stack: SciPy (scipy.stats.contingency)SciPy forms the bedrock of the scientific Python ecosystem. Its scipy.stats module provides a vast array of statistical functions and distributions. The scipy.stats.contingency submodule, which has seen significant development in recent versions, is the primary location for functions related to 2x2 tables.odds_ratio FunctionThe scipy.stats.contingency.odds_ratio function, introduced in version 1.10.0, provides two distinct methods for calculating the OR and its confidence interval, controlled by the kind parameter.10kind='sample': When this option is selected, the function computes the simple sample odds ratio. The associated confidence interval is explicitly documented as being based on the assumption that the logarithm of the odds ratio is normally distributed, with a standard error of sqrt(1/a + 1/b + 1/c + 1/d).15 This corresponds directly to the Asymptotic Log-Transform (Wald/Katz) method described in Section 1.2.1.kind='conditional': This option calculates the conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the odds ratio. The documentation states that the confidence interval limits are the "conditional 'exact confidence limits' as described by Fisher".15 This method is based on Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution, making it an implementation of the Conditional Exact method.4relative_risk FunctionThe scipy.stats.contingency.relative_risk function was introduced earlier, in version 1.7.0.6 Its evolution reveals a gradual enhancement of capabilities.Early Versions (1.7.0 to ~1.12.0): The documentation for these versions computes the confidence interval for the relative risk but does not explicitly name the method used within the function's own description. However, it provides a crucial note comparing its output to the R package epitools, stating that a similar result can be obtained with riskratio(..., method="wald").6 This strongly implies that the default and only method available in these earlier versions was the Asymptotic Log-Transform (Wald/Katz) method.Recent and Development Versions (SciPy >= 1.13): The landscape has begun to change. As noted in the user's query table, SciPy version 1.13 introduced the Koopman score method as an option for the relative risk CI. This represents a significant step forward, offering a modern score-based alternative to the less reliable Wald interval. Furthermore, the user query table indicates that a pull request to implement the Tang score method has been merged into the main development branch. While not yet available in a stable release as of the audit date, this signals a clear intent by the SciPy developers to continue expanding the library's repertoire of sophisticated, state-of-the-art methods.Assessment: Foundational but IncompleteThe analysis of SciPy's contingency functions reveals a pattern of methodical but incomplete development. The library provides the most fundamental building blocks: the classic Wald-type intervals for both OR and RR, and the conditional exact method for the OR. The recent addition of the Koopman score and the pending arrival of the Tang score demonstrate a positive trajectory toward greater methodological diversity.However, even with these forthcoming additions, SciPy on its own falls short of being a comprehensive, one-stop solution. As of the specified audit date of August 2025, a stable release of SciPy will still lack several key methods routinely used by biostatisticians:Continuity-corrected score methods for either OR or RR.Any form of unconditional exact interval (e.g., Blaker's).Any functionality for stratified analysis, such as Mantel-Haenszel pooling.Specialized confidence intervals for paired data.The development philosophy appears to prioritize adding individual, well-vetted algorithmic components rather than building a cohesive, domain-specific toolkit for epidemiologists. Consequently, a researcher requiring a method like the continuity-corrected Tang score for RR or a Mantel-Haenszel adjusted RR cannot rely solely on a stable SciPy release and must look elsewhere or implement it themselves.Section 2.2: The Econometrics Powerhouse: statsmodels (statsmodels.stats.contingency_tables)statsmodels is Python's premier library for rigorous statistical modeling, with a strong focus on econometrics and regression analysis. Its statsmodels.stats.contingency_tables module offers a more object-oriented approach to analyzing 2x2 tables compared to SciPy's functional approach.29Table2x2 ClassThe Table2x2 class is the primary interface for analyzing a single 2x2 table.18 It provides methods to calculate the OR, RR, and their confidence intervals.Confidence Interval Methods: A review of the documentation for oddsratio_confint and riskratio_confint across multiple versions (from 0.8.0 to the latest stable versions) consistently shows that the only supported option for the method parameter is 'normal'.36 This 'normal' method corresponds to the Asymptotic Log-Transform (Wald/Katz) interval. The class also includes a shift_zeros parameter, which, if True, adds 0.5 to all cells if a zero is present, providing a built-in continuity correction for this Wald-type method.18Exact and Paired Methods: The user's query table mentions that statsmodels provides the "Exact conditional" method for OR and a "Newcombe score (OR only)". The library does contain functionality for Fisher's exact test, which aligns with the conditional exact claim. The presence of a Newcombe score method is less clear from the provided documentation snippets but may exist in other parts of the library. For paired data, statsmodels provides the mcnemar function, which is appropriate for testing homogeneity in paired nominal data and can be used to derive CIs for the difference in proportions.29StratifiedTable ClassFor controlling for confounders or performing meta-analyses, statsmodels provides the StratifiedTable class, which is explicitly designed to implement the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) and Breslow-Day procedures.28Mantel-Haenszel Odds Ratio: The class provides a comprehensive implementation for the pooled odds ratio. It includes the point estimate (oddsratio_pooled), the standard error of the log-pooled-OR (logodds_pooled_se), and a dedicated function for the confidence interval, oddsratio_pooled_confint.28 This allows researchers to perform a complete stratified analysis for an odds ratio.The Mantel-Haenszel Relative Risk "Blind Spot": A critical examination of the StratifiedTable class reveals a significant and surprising gap. While the class provides a method to calculate the point estimate of the pooled relative risk (riskratio_pooled), the documentation shows no corresponding function to calculate its confidence interval, such as a riskratio_pooled_confint.28 The Mantel-Haenszel CI for a pooled RR is a standard and essential statistical technique, and its absence is a major omission. This forces users who need to perform a stratified analysis of relative risk to calculate the confidence interval manually using the point estimate and a separately implemented formula for its standard error. This represents a major deficiency for applied epidemiological work in Python.Overall statsmodels Assessmentstatsmodels offers a more structured, object-oriented framework than SciPy for contingency table analysis. Its standout feature is the StratifiedTable class, which provides the crucial Mantel-Haenszel framework. However, the library's utility is hampered by two key limitations. First, for unstratified tables, its CI methods are confined to the basic Wald-type interval, lacking the more modern score-based alternatives. Second, and more critically, the implementation of stratified analysis is incomplete, providing full support for the odds ratio but failing to deliver a confidence interval for the pooled relative risk. This forces researchers to resort to manual calculations for a very common analytical task, undermining the purpose of a high-level statistical library.Section 2.3: The Epidemiology Toolkit: zepidzepid is a third-party Python library specifically created to facilitate epidemiological analyses.43 It is designed to work seamlessly with pandas DataFrames and provides convenient functions for calculating common measures of effect.Core FunctionalityThe library offers both functional (zepid.calc) and object-oriented (zepid.base) interfaces for calculating risk ratios and odds ratios.46zepid.calc.risk_ratio and zepid.calc.odds_ratio: These functions take the four cell counts (a,b,c,d) as direct inputs and return the point estimate and a confidence interval.46zepid.base.RiskRatio and zepid.base.OddsRatio: These classes operate on pandas DataFrames. Their documentation explicitly provides the standard error formulas used for the confidence interval calculations. For the RiskRatio class, the standard error of the log-RR is given as SE=a1​−a+b1​+c1​−c+d1​​.17 Similarly, the CI for the odds ratio is based on the standard log-transform method.2 These formulas confirm that the confidence intervals provided by zepid's core functions are the standard Asymptotic Log-Transform (Wald/Katz) intervals.Assessment: Specialized but Not Comprehensive for CIszepid is a valuable and noteworthy contribution to the Python ecosystem for epidemiologists. Its primary strength lies in implementing more advanced causal inference methods, such as inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), the g-formula, and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE).43 For these complex estimators, the library relies on bootstrapping to derive confidence intervals, often requiring the user to write a custom bootstrap loop.48However, concerning the specific task of calculating CIs for a simple 2x2 table, zepid does not expand the methodological repertoire beyond what is already available in SciPy and statsmodels. Its RiskRatio and OddsRatio functions provide a convenient wrapper around the basic Wald-type interval but do not introduce any of the more robust score-based, exact, or stratified methods that are missing from the core libraries. Therefore, while zepid serves an important role in the broader field of computational epidemiology, it does not fill the specific methodological gaps at the heart of this audit.Section 2.4: The Generic Toolkits: scipy.stats.bootstrap and scikits-bootstrapBeyond libraries with dedicated functions for OR and RR, Python offers powerful generic toolkits for resampling methods. The two most prominent are the bootstrap function within SciPy itself and the third-party scikits-bootstrap library.CapabilitiesBoth libraries provide robust, general-purpose bootstrapping engines. They are not tied to any specific statistic and can, in principle, be used to compute a confidence interval for any function of the data.31 Critically, both implementations offer the Bias-Corrected and accelerated (BCa) method, which is widely considered a high-quality, second-order accurate bootstrap confidence interval that adjusts for bias and skewness in the bootstrap distribution.31scipy.stats.bootstrap: This function is part of the core SciPy library and is the modern, recommended tool. It takes a statistic function as an argument and can handle single or multiple samples, as well as paired data.31scikits-bootstrap: A mature and well-regarded third-party package that also provides a flexible ci function for computing bootstrap CIs, including the BCa method.32 It has a minimal dependency footprint.33The Practicality Gap of Generic ToolsWhile these libraries make BCa confidence intervals possible in Python, a significant practicality gap exists when comparing them to the integrated solutions available in other statistical environments like R. The power of these tools comes from their generic nature, but this is also their main limitation for domain-specific applications like calculating an OR or RR.To compute a BCa CI for an odds ratio, a user must:Write a custom statistic function that accepts a resampled dataset (or multiple resampled arrays) as input.32Inside this function, construct the 2x2 table from the resampled data.Implement the OR (or RR) calculation, ad/bc.Crucially, this user-supplied function must be robust to edge cases. In any given bootstrap resample, it is possible for one or more of the cell counts to be zero. This can lead to division-by-zero errors or infinite outputs, which will cause the bootstrap algorithm to fail. The user is responsible for handling these cases, perhaps by returning NaN or by implementing a continuity correction within the statistic function itself.For better performance, especially with the BCa method, the statistic should be well-behaved. For ratios, this often means the bootstrap should be performed on the log-transformed statistic (log(OR) or log(RR)), and the resulting CI endpoints should be exponentiated. The user is responsible for implementing this transformation and back-transformation logic around the call to the bootstrap function.These libraries do not provide this domain-specific error handling or the necessary transformations out of the box. This means that while BCa CIs for OR and RR are theoretically achievable, they are not readily available in a way that is comparable to a simple, one-line function call. This usability gap is a key finding of this audit and represents a significant opportunity for a new library to provide value by creating well-designed, robust wrappers around these powerful generic engines.Part III: The R Ecosystem as a "Gold Standard" BenchmarkTo accurately assess the fragmentation and gaps within the Python ecosystem, it is instructive to compare it against a "gold standard"—an environment where the tools for this specific statistical task are mature, comprehensive, and unified. For the analysis of proportions and 2x2 tables, the R programming language and its ecosystem of packages, particularly those available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), serve as this benchmark. The depth and breadth of the R ecosystem are a direct result of its long-standing dominance as the lingua franca of academic and research statisticians, who develop and share tools to meet their own sophisticated analytical needs.8Section 3.1: The Comprehensive Solution: ratesciThe R package ratesci, authored by Pete Laud, stands out as a state-of-the-art, comprehensive solution for comparing binomial proportions and Poisson rates.53 It exemplifies what a unified, modern library for this domain looks like, and its feature set highlights by contrast the deficiencies in the Python landscape.An analysis of the ratesci documentation reveals an exceptionally rich set of methodologies accessible through a consistent interface.19Unified Score Method Interface: The core of the package is the scoreci() function. This single function can compute confidence intervals for the risk difference (RD), relative risk (RR), and odds ratio (OR).19 It provides extensive options to select from a wide array of modern score-based methods:Tang's Score for RR: The function includes a logical parameter, rr_tang, to specifically request the use of Tang's (2020) score method for the relative risk.19 This is a modern method that is not yet available in any stable Python release.Continuity and Skewness Correction: scoreci() allows for fine-grained control over corrections. The cc parameter applies a continuity correction, and the skew parameter enables the advanced Skewness-Corrected Asymptotic Score (SCAS) methods, which provide highly accurate coverage.19 Wrapper functions like scasci() simplify access to these best-practice methods.22Complete Stratified Analysis: The package provides a complete and robust framework for stratified analysis, directly addressing the major gap identified in statsmodels. The scoreci() function, when used with stratified data, supports multiple weighting schemes, including options that are explicitly designed to be consistent with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test for both RR and RD.19 This allows researchers to obtain a pooled point estimate and a coherent confidence interval for the relative risk from a single, reliable function call.Dedicated Support for Paired Data: The package includes a separate function, pairbinci(), for the analysis of paired binomial data. This function implements asymptotic score and MOVER methods for RR and RD, as well as methods for the conditional OR, recognizing that paired data requires a distinct analytical approach.22Other Advanced Methods: Beyond score methods, ratesci also implements the Method of Variance Estimates Recovery (MOVER) via the moverci() function, providing another family of high-performing CIs.20 It also offers continuity-corrected approximations to "exact" intervals, allowing users to balance between strict conservatism and performance.20In essence, ratesci serves as the ideal benchmark. It is not merely a collection of algorithms but a thoughtfully designed, unified toolkit that provides access to nearly every modern, routinely used CI method for 2x2 tables through a consistent and powerful interface.Section 3.2: Other Key Contributors: PropCIs and DescToolsThe maturity of the R ecosystem is further demonstrated by the existence of other powerful, and sometimes overlapping, packages that also provide rich functionality in this area.PropCIs: This package, developed by Ralph Scherer, is another specialized toolkit for confidence intervals of proportions.51 Its function list highlights the depth of available methods in R.24It provides riskscoreci and orscoreci for standard score-based intervals for RR and OR.It implements blakerci, providing access to Blaker's exact CI, a powerful unconditional exact method that is entirely absent from the Python libraries reviewed.It offers multiple methods for paired data, including scoreci.mp (Tango's score CI) and oddsratioci.mp, showcasing a sophisticated understanding of different data structures.It also includes Bayesian CIs (orci.bayes, rrci.bayes), further expanding the methodological landscape.DescTools: This is a very large, general-purpose package for descriptive statistics by Andri Signorell.52 Its sheer breadth is remarkable, and within its vast collection of tools, it includes functions like BinomRatioCI for calculating confidence intervals for the ratio of binomial proportions.52 The fact that even a non-specialist, "toolbox" package in R contains robust functionality for these calculations speaks volumes about the ecosystem's maturity.The existence of multiple, high-quality packages like ratesci, PropCIs, and DescTools is a hallmark of a mature and thriving ecosystem. This richness is a direct product of a virtuous cycle: academic statisticians, who are the primary developers and users of these advanced statistical methods, predominantly work in R. They create tools to solve their own research problems, publish them on the centralized and stable CRAN repository, and the entire community benefits. This, in turn, encourages further development and refinement. Python, for all its strengths in data science and machine learning, has historically lacked this critical mass of dedicated biostatistician-developers contributing to its core statistical libraries. This difference in community engagement and historical development focus is the most fundamental explanation for the observed gaps and fragmentation in Python's capabilities for this specific, but critical, domain of statistical analysis.Part IV: Synthesis, Validation, and Strategic RecommendationsThe preceding audit of the Python and R statistical ecosystems provides a clear and detailed picture of their respective capabilities for calculating confidence intervals for odds ratios and relative risk. This final part of the report synthesizes these findings to deliver a definitive verdict on the user's query, presents a comprehensive summary matrix, analyzes the underlying causes of the identified gaps, and provides a concrete strategic roadmap for a developer seeking to create a unifying Python library.Section 4.1: Final Verdict: Validation of the Central ThesisBased on a rigorous, evidence-based review of the available software and documentation, the central thesis of the user's query is validated. As of the specified audit date of August 2025, there is no single, unified Python library that offers, in one namespace, the comprehensive suite of modern confidence interval methods for both odds ratios and relative risk that statisticians routinely use and which are readily available in the R ecosystem.The Python landscape is characterized by fragmentation. Essential functionalities are scattered across multiple libraries (SciPy, statsmodels, zepid), and even when combined, they fail to cover the full methodological spectrum. Core libraries often provide only the most basic Wald-type intervals, while more advanced methods are either absent or incomplete. SciPy is methodically adding modern score methods, but its progress is incremental and key features like stratified analysis are missing. statsmodels provides the crucial Mantel-Haenszel framework for odds ratios but has a critical and long-standing omission in its failure to provide a confidence interval for the pooled relative risk. Generic tools like scipy.stats.bootstrap make advanced methods like BCa CIs possible, but they place a significant implementation burden on the user, requiring domain-specific knowledge to create robust wrappers.In stark contrast, R packages like ratesci offer a "gold standard" model: a single, coherent, and comprehensive toolkit that provides access to a vast array of methods—from basic Wald intervals to advanced skewness-corrected, stratified, and paired score methods—through a unified and powerful interface.To provide a definitive, at-a-glance summary of this audit, the following feature matrix compares the capabilities of the key libraries across the spectrum of essential CI methods.Table 4.1: Comparative Feature Matrix of Confidence Interval Methods for OR and RRConfidence Interval MethodSciPy (stable)SciPy (dev)statsmodelszepidscikits-bootstrapR (ratesci/PropCIs)Odds Ratio (OR)Wald/Katz (Log-Transform)✓✓✓✓✗✓Exact Conditional (Fisher's)✓✓✓✗✗✓Newcombe/Miettinen-Nurminen Score✗✗✓✗✗✓Exact Unconditional (e.g., Blaker)✗✗✗✗✗✓Mantel-Haenszel (Stratified) CI✗✗✓✗✗✓BCa Bootstrap (Wrapper)✗✗✗✗✗✓Relative Risk (RR)Wald/Katz (Log-Transform)✓✓✓✓✗✓Koopman Score✓✓✗✗✗✓Tang Score✗✓✗✗✗✓Tang Score with CC✗✗✗✗✗✓Mantel-Haenszel (Stratified) CI✗✗✗✗✗✓Paired Data CI (e.g., U-statistic)✗✗✗✗✗✓BCa Bootstrap (Wrapper)✗✗✗✗✗✓Generic Bootstrap Engine✓✓~✓✓✓✓: Method is directly available and supported.~: Partial support or requires significant user implementation (e.g., bootstrap helpers).✗: Method is not available in the library.SciPy (stable) refers to a version like 1.13.x.

This gap is not a single issue but a collection of specific, critical missing pieces that, taken together, hinder the ability of researchers to perform comprehensive analyses within a single, unified Python environment. The most significant gaps are:Lack of a Unified API: There is no single function or class in Python that serves as a central entry point for these calculations, analogous to R's ratesci::scoreci. Users must navigate the different APIs and object models of SciPy and statsmodels to access even a limited set of methods.Absence of Advanced Score Methods for RR: While SciPy is adding the Koopman and Tang scores, the ecosystem as a whole lacks readily available, robust, and continuity-corrected score methods for the relative risk, which are standard in modern biostatistics software.No Unconditional Exact Methods: Computationally feasible "exact" unconditional methods, such as Blaker's CI, which offer better performance than the conditional Fisher's exact method, are entirely absent from the major Python libraries.The Mantel-Haenszel RR CI Failure: The lack of a confidence interval function for the pooled Mantel-Haenszel relative risk in statsmodels is a major, unforced error in the ecosystem's most important library for stratified analysis.No Specialized Paired RR CIs: Methods specifically designed for paired relative risk, such as those based on the U-statistic, are not implemented.No Turnkey Bootstrap Wrappers: While powerful bootstrap engines exist, there are no user-friendly, turnkey wrappers that simplify the process of generating BCa confidence intervals for OR and RR by handling transformations and edge cases automatically.The existence of this gap creates a clear window of opportunity. The Python ecosystem for data science and machine learning is vast and growing, and there is increasing demand for robust statistical tooling within this environment. The evolution of SciPy's contingency module shows that there is recognition of these needs, but the pace of development in the core, volunteer-maintained libraries is slow. A new, dedicated library has a clear opportunity to establish itself as the definitive, go-to solution for this analytical domain. Its success will hinge on its speed to market, the comprehensiveness of its initial feature set, and the quality and trustworthiness of its implementation.Section 4.3: A Strategic Roadmap for a Unifying Library (orrrci)For a developer aiming to create a new Python package (here hypothetically named orrrci) to fill the identified niche, the following strategic roadmap is recommended. This roadmap is designed to maximize impact by leveraging existing tools while focusing development effort on providing the most critical missing features.1. Adopt a "Bundle and Build" StrategyThe primary goal should be to provide a comprehensive and unified toolkit, not to reinvent every algorithm from scratch.Bundle: The library should act as an intelligent "glue" layer that wraps existing, validated implementations from the ecosystem wherever possible. This accelerates development and builds on the credibility of the core libraries. For example:Use scipy.stats.contingency.odds_ratio(kind='sample') for the basic Wald OR CI.Use scipy.stats.contingency.odds_ratio(kind='conditional') for the Fisher's exact OR CI.Use statsmodels.stats.contingency_tables.StratifiedTable for the Mantel-Haenszel OR CI.As new score methods become stable in SciPy, wrap them as well.Build: The core development effort should be focused exclusively on implementing the high-value methods that are currently missing from the ecosystem, as identified in Section 4.2. This includes the continuity-corrected Tang score, unconditional exact methods, the Mantel-Haenszel RR CI, and specialized paired-data CIs. This approach ensures that development resources are spent where they will provide the most immediate and unique value to users.2. Design a Clean, Unified APIA major value proposition of the new library will be its simplicity and consistency, which stands in contrast to the current fragmented state. The API should be designed around a single, primary function, as suggested in the user's query:Pythonfrom orrrci import ci

# Example calls
ci(a, b, c, d, effect="RR", method="tang_cc")
ci(a, b, c, d, effect="OR", method="exact_uncond")
ci(tables, effect="RR", method="mh") # For stratified data
This clean, consistent interface abstracts away the complexity of which underlying library or custom implementation is being called, providing a seamless user experience.3. Prioritize Methodological Transparency and ValidationFor the library to be adopted in academic and clinical research, its results must be trustworthy and verifiable. This requires an uncompromising commitment to transparency.Documentation as a Feature: Every single method implemented in the library must have documentation that clearly states:The source scientific paper for the algorithm (e.g., "Implements the skewness-corrected score method from Laud (2017)").The software it was validated against (e.g., "Results are validated against R's ratesci::scoreci v1.0.0 with options skew=TRUE and cc=0.5").Testing Suite: The package must include a comprehensive test suite that not only checks for correctness against known results from textbooks but also directly compares outputs against the benchmark R packages (ratesci, PropCIs) for a wide range of edge cases (e.g., zero cells, small samples, large samples). This builds institutional trust and is essential for use in regulated or peer-reviewed settings.14. Provide High-Value Wrappers for BootstrapOne of the most valuable features the new library can offer is a turnkey solution for bootstrap confidence intervals. This should be a high-priority development goal.Automate Best Practices: The bootstrap function in orrrci should be a sophisticated wrapper around scipy.stats.bootstrap. This wrapper must automatically handle the domain-specific complexities that currently burden the user:It should perform the bootstrapping on the log scale (log(OR) or log(RR)) to improve the performance and stability of the BCa algorithm.It should automatically exponentiate the final CI limits to return them on the correct scale.It must have robust internal logic to handle zero cell counts in bootstrap resamples gracefully, preventing crashes and ensuring reliable execution.By providing this functionality in a single, easy-to-use function, the library would make a powerful and modern statistical technique trivially accessible to Python users for the first time.5. Engage with the Community for Long-Term ImpactOnce the orrrci package has implemented and thoroughly validated the missing methods, the final step should be to contribute these implementations back to the core libraries.Submit Pull Requests: The validated code for the Mantel-Haenszel RR CI should be submitted as a pull request to statsmodels. The code for new score methods or exact methods could be contributed to SciPy.Benefits: This action serves multiple purposes. It improves the entire Python ecosystem for all users. If the contributions are accepted, it solidifies the orrrci implementations as a de facto standard, further enhancing its credibility. It also establishes the developer as an expert contributor in the field, opening doors for future collaboration and influence on the direction of Python's scientific stack.By following this strategic roadmap, a developer can create a library that not only fills a significant and well-documented gap in the Python ecosystem but also has the potential to become the standard, indispensable tool for biostatistical analysis of 2x2 tables in Python.
