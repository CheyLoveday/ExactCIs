# Recommendations for Refactoring and Performance Improvements

This document outlines strategies for improving the `midp` and `unconditional` confidence interval implementations. The primary goals are to reduce code duplication by abstracting shared logic and to significantly improve the performance of the unconditional method.

### General Advice & Shared Code Refactoring

The most impactful change is to abstract the common logic shared between `midp.py` and `unconditional.py`. Both methods perform the same fundamental task: searching for the two values of `theta` (the odds ratio) where a p-value function crosses the `alpha/2` threshold.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Create a `_search.py` or `_common.py` module:** This module will house the shared logic for finding confidence intervals.

2.  **Implement a Generic Interval Search Function:** This function will handle the core search algorithm. It will take the specific p-value calculation logic as a function argument, making it reusable.

    A possible signature could be:
    ```python
    def find_confidence_interval(p_value_func, x1, n1, x2, n2, alpha):
        # ... implementation ...
    ```

    The function's responsibilities would be:
    a.  Define the search range for `theta`.
    b.  Create the search grid.
    c.  Calculate p-values for each `theta` on the grid by calling `p_value_func(theta, x1, n1, x2, n2)`.
    d.  Identify the lowest and highest `theta` values where the p-value is >= `alpha/2`.
    e.  Return the `(ci_lower, ci_upper)` tuple.

3.  **Refactor `midp.py` and `unconditional.py`:** The main functions in these modules will become much simpler. They will each define their specific p-value calculation function and pass it to the generic `find_confidence_interval` function. This will significantly reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

### Improving the Mid-P Method (`midp.py`)

The current grid search is effective but can be made more precise and efficient.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Implement Adaptive Grid Refinement:** Instead of a single, large, fixed-size grid, adopt a two-pass approach:
    *   **Pass 1:** Use a coarse grid to find the approximate location of the confidence limits.
    *   **Pass 2:** Create a new, much finer grid only in the small regions around those approximate limits and re-run the search there.
    This provides high precision where it's needed without wasting computation.

2.  **Remove Heuristic Adjustments:** With adaptive grid refinement, the final `* 0.9` or `* 1.1` adjustment should become unnecessary. If a boundary isn't found, it's better to systematically widen the initial search range rather than applying an arbitrary correction.

### Improving the Unconditional Method (`unconditional.py`)

The primary bottleneck is performance. The current brute-force grid search is too slow for this method.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Replace Grid Search with a Root-Finding Algorithm:** This is the most critical improvement. The problem can be framed as finding the roots of the equation `p_value(theta) - alpha/2 = 0`.

    *   **Use `scipy.optimize.brentq`:** This algorithm is ideal for this task. It is fast, accurate, and robust for finding roots within a given interval. You would call it twice: once to find the lower bound and once for the upper bound.

    *   The function passed to `brentq` would be a simple lambda:
        ```python
        lambda theta: profile_p_value_func(theta, ...) - alpha/2
        ```

    This change will dramatically improve performance, making the method practical even for large sample sizes by evaluating the expensive p-value function only as many times as needed to converge on the solution.
