Unconditional Method
-------------------

The unconditional method (Barnard's test) provides exact confidence intervals without conditioning on the margins.

Conditional Method
----------------

The conditional method (Fisher's exact test) provides confidence intervals conditioning on the margins.

Blaker's Method
-------------

Blaker's method provides an alternative approach to calculating exact confidence intervals.

Mid-P Method
----------

The Mid-P method provides a less conservative alternative to Fisher's exact test by using the mid-p-value.

Wald Method
---------

The Wald method provides asymptotic confidence intervals based on the normal approximation.
